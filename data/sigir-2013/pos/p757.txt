ABSTRACT
Community Question Answering (CQA) platforms contain
a large number of questions and associated answers. Answerers sometimes include URLs as part of the answers to
provide further information. This paper describes a novel
way of building a test collection for web search by exploiting the link information from this type of social media data.
We propose to build the test collection by regarding CQA
questions as queries and the associated linked web pages as
relevant documents. To evaluate this approach, we collect
approximately ten thousand CQA queries, whose answers
contained links to ClueWeb09 documents after spam filtering. Experimental results using this collection show that
the relative effectiveness between different retrieval models
on the ClueWeb-CQA query set is consistent with that on
the TREC Web Track query sets, confirming the reliability
of our test collection. Further analysis shows that the large
number of queries generated through this approach compensates for the sparse relevance judgments in determining
significant differences.

but this is not available for general use in academic environments. In this paper, we explore an approach to generating
a set of queries and relevance judgments for a collection of
web documents by exploiting the information in social media, and more specifically Community Question Answering
services. CQA sites such as Yahoo! Answers1 and Baidu
Zhidao2 provide social platforms for users to raise questions,
to obtain useful information and to share potential answers.
The collaborative nature of such platforms motivates interested users to voluntarily engage in providing useful answers
to many topics. Answerers sometimes provide URLs as part
of their answers. These links are used to provide additional
information, to explain more complicated concepts that can
not be detailed in short paragraphs, or to present reliable
citations, etc. Figure 1 shows an example of an answer that
incorporates several URLs.
The central hypothesis of this paper is that these links can
be regarded as relevant documents for the CQA question (or
query). Although the relevance judgments obtained in this
way are likely to be sparse, our expectation is that the large
number of queries obtained will compensate for this.
In this paper, we collected a large number of questionanswer pairs from existing and newly crawled CQA collections. We then reduced this set to include only questions
whose answers contained links, where the links pointed to
documents in the ClueWeb09 collection. The final ClueWebCQA (CW-CQA) set of queries and relevance judgments was
produced after some additional filtering to deal with issues

such as spam. To test the validity of this new test collection,
the relative effectiveness of some well-known benchmark retrieval models is evaluated and compared. Our CW-CQA
results show that a term dependency model significantly outperforms a bag of words model, and pseudo-relevance feedback techniques can be helpful in most cases. These findings
are consistent with the results using standard TREC Web
Track query sets. As expected, the relevance judgments are
sparse and incomplete. Carterette et al. [4] demonstrated
that, up to a point, evaluation over more queries with fewer
judgments is as reliable as fewer queries with more judgments. Similarly, we show that evaluating using a sufficient
number of queries shows significant differences between retrieval models despite the incomplete relevance judgments.
The rest of paper is laid out as follows. Section 2 summarizes related work and Section 3 describes the methodology
of building the CW-CQA test collection. We discuss the
experimental results in Section 4. Section 5 makes closing
remarks and discusses several future directions.

the ratio of spam links among LQ 4 . Varying SR and SA affects the final number of queries and the proportion of spam
links. After filtering, we can establish our final CW-CQA
test collection by using the remaining questions and associated links as test queries and relevance judgments. We
dicuss the parameter settings in Section 4.

3.2 Retrieval Models
We test four existing retrieval models including query likelihood model (QLM), relevance model (RM) [8], sequential
dependency model (SDM) [9] and a query expansion model
using latent concept expansion (LCE) [10]. We choose these
models because they include both common baselines used in
other papers and methods that are state-of-the-art in terms
of effectiveness.
QLM computes the likelihood of generating query texts
based on documents models, and can often be written as:
X
rank
P (Q|D) =
log(P (qi |D))
qi ∈Q

RELATED WORK

There have been several web test collections created for
supporting reproducible experiments at TREC. Examples
include .GOV2, WT2g, and WT10g as well as a recent larger
collection ClueWeb09. For large collections, relevance judging is mostly done through pooling techniques [7]. Such techniques assemble and judge results from multiple searches and
systems, with the assumption that most relevant documents
will be found.
Even with the use of pooling methods, creating relevance
judgments is often costly and the judged results can be biased and incomplete [2]. Buckley and Voorhees [1] proposed
the metric bpref that is both highly correlated with existing measures when complete judgments are available and
more robust to incomplete judgment sets. For the Million
Query Track at TREC 2007, Carterette et al. [4] presented
two document selection algorithms [3] to acquire relevance
judgments. Their results suggested that, up to a point, evaluation over more queries with fewer judgments is more costeffective and as reliable as fewer queries with more judgments.

SDM is an effective instantiation of the Markov random
field for information retrieval (MRF-IR) that makes the sequential dependence assumption. It ranks documents by:
P
rank
P (D|Q) = λT qi ∈Q fT (qi , D)
P
+λO qi ∈Q fO (qi , qi+1 , D)
P
+λU qi ∈Q fU (qi , qi+1 , D)
LCE is a robust query expansion technique based on MRFIR. This technique provides a mechanism for modeling term
dependencies during expansion. The central idea is to compute a probability distribution over latent concepts using a
set of pseudo-relevant documents in response to Q. Retrieval
is then done by incorporating the top k latent concepts with
the highest likelihood into original MRF model. Details of
these models can be found in the appropriate papers.

METHODOLOGY

3.1 Test Collection

4. EXPERIMENTS

We build the CW-CQA test collection using large CQA
datasets and the web collection ClueWeb09 3 . We obtain a
large number of question-answer pairs from the CQA corpora and harvest all links provided in answers. We then
reduce this set to include only questions whose answers contained links pointing to ClueWeb09 documents. We obseve
that some of the links contained in CQA answers can be considered to be spam pages. To ensure a reliable test collection, we filter the reduced question sets based on two spamcontrolling parameters SR and SA . Cormack et al [5] proposed a content-based classifier that quantifies the “spamminess” of a document based on a scale of 0 to 100, where a
lower score indicates that the page has a higher likelihood to
be spam. Accordingly, SA calculates the average spam score
of all links LQ extracted for a question Q and SR records

4.1 Building The Collection
CQA datasets. We used two large CQA datasets, Yahoo
Webscope L6 (Y6) 5 and a recently crawled Yahoo! Answers
dataset (YA). Corpus Y6 provides a 10/25/2007 Yahoo! Answers dump. We additionally crawled the YA corpus by using the Yahoo! Answers API. Specifically, we collected up
to 10,000 questions for each of the 26 Yahoo root categories
as well as their corresponding answers 6 . Table 1 shows the
number of questions NQ , the average number of associated
answers per question NAavg , and the average number of links
per question NLavg in first row.

We consider a page with spam score below 60 to be spam.

containing 3440 questions. The maximum nurl in query sets
10k and 3k are respectively 22 and 19, and the minimum for
both is 2. The relation of nurl and nQurl remains as power
law distributions for both query sets. The nature of CQA
questions can make the queries quite long. We apply stop
structure removal techniques [6] to the CW-CQA queries
and Figure 3 compares the query length distributions.
For comparison, we use 148 standard TREC web track
2009, 2010 and 2011 title and description (desc) queries. We
search these TREC queries on ClueWeb09 CatB and evaluate the results using standard TREC relevance judgments.
Figure 3 suggests that the CW-CQA queries are more similar to TREC description queries in terms of query length.
Retrieval Setup. Indri 8 is used for indexing and searching. We use Dirichlet smoothing with µ = 2500 for all runs
without tuning. We apply spam filtering to all retrieval runs
based on [5]. We evaluate using the top 1000 documents and
report mean average precision (MAP), precision at 10/100
(P@10, P@100), mean reciprocal rank (MRR) and bpref.

4.2 Retrieval Performance

Connecting CQA and ClueWeb. To find connections, we then compared the CQA links with two subsets of
ClueWeb09 pages, namely Category A (CatA) and Category
B (CatB), which contain approximately 500M and 50M English documents, respectively. The second and third rows in
Table 1 summarize the number of questions whose answers
contained links to the ClueWeb data NQ and their corresponding NLavg 7 . Figure 2 shows the relation between the
number of links each question has (nurl ) and the frequency
of questions with nurl links (nQurl ). Since this is a log-log
plot, Figure 2 shows that nurl and nQurl follow a power law
distribution; that is, questions with few links occupy a significant portion of entire population. R2 statistics show the
goodness of the fit. The connection distributions for CatA
and CatB resemble each other; in the following, we focus
on evaluation using the ClueWeb09 CatB connections and
searching on CatB for computational efficiency.
Queries and Relevance Judgments. To build the final test collection, we aggregate questions from Y6 and YA
constrained by SR ≤ 0.1, SA ≥ 90 and nurl > 1. The constraint nurl > 1 is used to avoid the extremes in the power
law distributions shown in Figure 2. A final set of 9988
questions are selected as the CW-CQA test queries and the
associated links are regarded as relevance judgments. This
set is denoted as the 10k set. We construct an additional
query set by selecting queries from 10k that have at least
one relevant document returned by any of the four retrieval
models described in Section 3, resulting in the query set 3k

Table 2 shows the retrieval performance of the CW-CQA
query sets 10k and 3k where the top performing runs are
underlined. We perform paired t-tests on pairs of retrieval
models (QLM, SDM), (QLM, RM) and (SDM, LCE). Specifically, RM and SDM are marked † if p-value < 0.05 compared to QLM. LCE is marked ⋆ if p-value < 0.05 compared
to SDM. We observe that SDM significantly outperforms
QLM in both query sets for every metric. RM can significantly improve QLM for most metrics, showing the utility
of pseudo-relevance feedback. LCE seems to improve SDM,
but the significant difference is only observed for metrics
P@100 and bpref. In general, models SDM and LCE are the
most effective compared to others. The performance of the
10k and 3k query sets show similar trends. For query set 3k,
MRR shows that on average all models rank the first known
relevant document above rank 20.
Table 3 shows the retrieval performance of TREC title and
desc queries. Similar to CW-CQA results, SDM significantly
outperforms QLM in all cases. For title queries, unlike CWCQA results, pseudo-relevance feedback techniques such as
RM and LCE sometimes can hurt performance of QLM and
SDM, respectively. The utility of pseudo-relevance feedback
is more evident for desc queries. The similarity of the query
length for CW-CQA queries and TREC descriptions provides a possible explanation for the higher level of consistency between their results.
In general, the relative effectiveness between retrieval models is similar for CW-CQA and TREC queries. The improvements based on term dependency modeling are significant

These initial experimental results indicate several directions for future work. Validating consistency with manual
relevance judgments will be important for our study. We
plan to select a small set of queries for human assessors
to judge, and compare the results with the automated approach. In addition, we will evaluate the same method using
the newly constructed ClueWeb12 collection. The CW-CQA
query sets for both ClueWeb09 and ClueWeb12 will be distributed through the Lemur project.

for all query sets.
The absolute retrieval performance in Table 2 is rather
low compared to Table 3. This is to be expected given the
sparseness of relevance judgments. Carterette et al. [4] suggested that evaluation over more queries with fewer judgments can be reliable. Similarly, an interesting question
from our perspective is: how many queries do we need to
confirm the existence of significant differences between retrieval models? To this end, we compute the p-value between QLM and SDM using different number of CW-CQA
queries. Specifically, from the 3k set, we randomly sample
k queries where k ranges from 100 to 3400 in steps of 100.
We perform 20 random samples at each k and report the
average p-value in Figure 4. All metrics share a tendency
that using more queries results in smaller p-values. For metrics such as MAP, MRR and P@10, stable significance (i.e.,
p-value < 0.05) is reached when the sample size grows beyond 2100. For other metrics such as P@100 and bpref, a
sample size of more than 1000 queries is sufficient to confirm
a significant difference. These observations support [4] in a
sense that evaluating using a sufficient number of CW-CQA
queries distinguishes retrieval model effectiveness despite incomplete judgments.

CONCLUSIONS

We proposed a novel way of building a test collection for
web search by considering CQA questions as queries and
the associated URLs as relevant documents. This approach
has the advantage that a large number of queries and relevance judgments can be gathered automatically and efficiently. We filtered CW-CQA queries based on the spam
scores of their links. Experimental results on the CW-CQA
query sets show that the relative effectiveness between different retrieval models is consistent with previous findings using the TREC queries, showing the reliability of the test collection. The relevance judgments for the CW-CQA queries
are incomplete and the absolute retrieval performance is relatively low. However, we demonstrated that evaluation using a sufficient number of queries ensures that significant
