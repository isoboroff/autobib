conceptual representation rather than simple keywords to enhance
the representation of queries and documents. Modeling and
developing domain ontologies is a fundamental framework for
representing knowledge using a set of concepts and the
relationships among the concepts. Medical domain knowledge is
developed by several different ontologies including Unified
Medical Language System (UMLS). The UMLS Metathesaurus
contains millions of biomedical and health related concepts. This
thesaurus is classified by concepts and connects each concept to
its alternative names and views in other source vocabularies. It
also determines appropriate relationships among concepts. The
structural framework of UMLS ontologies aids us in categorizing
concepts and locating related and similar concepts automatically.
Achieving an IR model capable of exploiting semantics requires
proper relatedness/similarity measures [6]. Semantic relatedness
and semantic similarity in medical domain are useful measures for
effective natural language processing, artificial intelligence and
IR. Similarity measures determine how similar two concepts are
by calculating how close they are in the UMLS semantic network
hierarchy. Relatedness measures determine how related two
concepts are by using concepts definition information.

ABSTRACT
Clinical information retrieval (IR) presents several challenges
including terminology mismatch and granularity mismatch. One
of the main objectives in clinical IR is to fill the semantic gap
among the queries and documents and go beyond keywords
matching. To address these issues, in this paper we attempt to use
semantic information to improve the performance of clinical IR
systems by representing queries in an expressive and meaningful
context. To model a query context initially we model and develop
query domain ontology. The query domain ontology represents
concepts closely related with query concepts. Query context
represents concepts extracted from query domain ontology and
weighted according to their semantic relatedness to query
concept(s). The query context is then exploited in query expansion
and patients’ records re-ranking for improving clinical retrieval
performance. We evaluate our approach on the TREC Medical
Records dataset. Results show that our proposed approach
significantly improves the retrieval performance compare to
classic keyword-based IR model.

Categories and Subject Descriptors

Clinical IR presents several specific challenges such as granularity
mismatch [12] and terminology mismatch. In [12] authors tackle
the issue of granularity mismatch by exploiting subsumption
relationships extracted from medical domain knowledge
resources, where subsumption relationships are defined as parentchild relationships when one concept is a subset of another
concept. Keyword-based IR models could return imprecise and
erroneous results due to their dependency on specific keywords.
Concept-based representation approaches are intended to
overcome this limitation by representing queries and documents
with semantic concepts using biomedical resources such as
UMLS. However previous work demonstrated that these
approaches should be combined with term-based approaches for
better performance [9]. In [5] authors tackle the issue of
terminology mismatch by proposing a technique to represent
queries with only medical concepts crucial to information need. In
their method, they represent queries and documents using medical
concepts that are directly related to symptoms, diagnosis,
diagnosis test and treatment. One of the other challenges in
medical IR is to retrieve those relevant documents that don’t
contain queries’ concepts but contain concepts that are associated
with them. For example a query may contain specific disease
whereas the relevant document may contain symptoms of that
disease. Our proposed approach attempts to address the presented
challenges by modeling meaningful and expressive query context
that represents the most related concepts to query concepts.

1. INTRODUCTION
Due to increasing volume of digitalized medical patient records,
the need for advanced information retrieval systems increases.
Digitalized medical patient records contain valuable information
that are usually embedded in medical reports in the form of
medical history, allergies, lab results, discharge summaries and
progress notes. This makes it difficult for clinicians to rapidly and
effectively access the desired records and the need for effective IR
system arises.
One of the main objectives in clinical IR is to fill the semantic gap
between the queries and documents and go beyond keywords
matching. One of the characteristics of semantic search is

In this paper, we propose a novel IR approach that is able to tackle
the presented challenges of clinical IR such as terminology
mismatch and granularity mismatch and to capture those relevant
documents not containing queries’ keywords explicitly. The

.

proposed model also attempts to fulfill the objective of filling
semantic gap between queries and documents. This model is
capable of combining search by meaning and search by keyword
and it uses a WordNet-based [6] semantic relatedness measure to
calculate relatedness of pair of concepts. In this approach we
develop query domain ontology for each query using the UMLS
ontology. Concepts in the domain ontology are then weighted
according to their relatedness to the original query concepts.
Query context contains all the concepts in query domain ontology
that have a related score above a specific threshold. The query
context is used to enhance classical IR model and to calculate and
assign a new score to documents by considering semantics. The
key unique contributions in our paper concern (1) modeling query
domain ontologies to extract representative concepts to
information need and (2) modeling medical query context based
on the modeled ontology and weight the concepts semantically in
relation to the query according to a semantic-based concept
weighting schema.

contain hearing impairment concept but contains the associated
treatment Hearing aid, our proposed model will retrieve it since it
contains a concept that is in hearing impairment domain ontology.
However related concepts receive a different weight from the
original query concept(s).
The query context of each query consists of all the concepts in
their modeled domain ontology. In order to identify the extent of a
concept relevancy in relation with query concept we weight each
concept in query domain ontology according to its semantic
relatedness to the query concept. For the purpose of this study we
use Gloss Vector semantic [8] relatedness measure. This choice
relies on the fact that this measure relies on concepts definitions
information rather than semantic network hierarchy; therefore it is
able to calculate semantic relatedness of pair of concepts in
different UMLS ontologies. This measure represents concepts by
vectors of co- occurrences. Co- occurrences refer to words that
commonly occur close to each other in a corpus of text. This
measure calculates relatedness of pair of concepts by combining
the structure and content of WordNet with co-occurrence
information. The value of semantic relatedness indicates the
relatedness of pair of concepts, the higher the value the higher the
semantic relatedness. The semantic relatedness of pair of concepts
is between 0 and 1, the value is 1 if two concepts are identical and
0 if they are not related.

2. SEMANTIC-BASED APPROACH
Our approach attempts to enhance classical IR model by
exploiting semantic relatedness to fulfill the objective of searching
by meaning representation of content. To achieve this, we model a
query context for each query, where each concept is weighted
according to its relatedness to query concept(s). The query context
is then exploited in the patient records query expansion and reranking for improving clinical retrieval performance.

A prerequisite step for modeling a representative query context is
modeling query domain ontology. In order to find the most
qualified concepts representing query context we model and
develop query domain ontology for each query using UMLS
Metathesaurus. To develop query domain ontology, first we map
query keywords to UMLS concepts using MetaMap [1]. MetaMap
is a program developed by National Library of Medicine (NLM),
which maps biomedical texts to the UMLS Metathesaurus. Second
we extract all the concepts that have semantic relationship with
the query concept(s) in UMLS ontologies. The Metathesaurus
contains synonymous and non-synonymous relationships between
concepts from the same source vocabulary as well as concepts in
different vocabularies. In general, the relationships connect
closely related concepts, such as those that share some common
property or are related by definition. Semantic relationships can
be of different types including SY (synonym), RB (broader
relationship), RN (narrower relationship), SIB (sibling) etc. The
main motivation for including synonymous and non-synonymous
relationships for modeling query concepts domain ontology is to
capture all the concepts closely related to the query concept(s).
Concepts extraction is capped at second level to avoid concepts
that are not in a close relation with query concepts. This ontology
is capable of addressing the issue of granularity mismatch by
including the parent-child relationship, where the child concept is
a subset of the parent concept. This ontology is also capable of
tackling the problem of retrieving those relevant documents not
containing queries’ keywords explicitly but containing concepts
semantically related to the queries, since it includes alternative
names and views of the same concept as well as concepts that are
closely related to the query concept(s).

records. These documents are organized by visits and there are a
total of 17,267 visits and 101’711 reports in which, each visit
contains between 1 to 415 reports. Relevance judgments are
binary and reflect whether a visit is relevant or not with respect to
the query.

We use the modeled query context to expand the original queries
where concepts are presented using their preferred terms. The
preferred term is the string preferred in UMLS Metathesaurus as
the name of the concept. The query expansion process is
performed by integrating the keyword-based query context CTXq
in to the IR process, where we use DFR-based dependence model.

Since our model can only take advantage of query terms, it is
necessary to refine initial retrieval results by taking concepts into
consideration [11]. To re-rank the initial results according to
query context, documents are semantically indexed using
MetaMap [1] and represented by concept unique identifiers (CUI).

3. EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS

4. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

In our search experiments, we examine the impact of combining
conceptual search using query context with the standard retrieval
and compare it with the standard retrieval performance using the
original keyword-based queries. The standard retrieval is based on
DFR-based dependence model [7]. We use Terrier [7] for
indexing and retrieval of term-based representation where we
apply porter stemming and we remove general stop words. We
also added specific stop words that are very frequent in medical
domain such as patient, hospital, medical, etc as suggested by [2].

Our evaluation objective is to evaluate the performance of
combining conceptual search with standard retrieval and compare
it to standard retrieval. Our hypothesis is that combining our
method of conceptual search with classic term-based IR model
improves the retrieval performance. Table 1 presents the retrieval
performance of the runs using TREC’s official measures: MAP,
R-precision, bprerf, precision@5 (P@5) and precision@10
(P@10).
The baseline-Termbased run is based on DFR-based (Divergence
from Randomness) dependence model, which incorporates term
dependency in the DFR framework. This run is based on
sequential dependency (SD) and is performed using term-based
representation of documents and queries. The conceptual-DFR run
is based on re-ranking the results that are obtained from query
expansion using keyword-based query context. The query
expansion is performed by integrating the keyword-based query
context into DFR-based sequential dependence model where
concepts are presented as keywords rather than CUIs. Results are
then re-ranked based on the CUI-based query context using the
conceptual representation of documents. In this run documents
scores are calculated based on eq. 3. This run is based on α=0.2
and weight threshold of 0.9, which were found to be effective in
our experimental settings.

For query context modeling we conduct experiments to find the
optimal value for α and weight threshold. Query context contains
concepts with weight or semantic relatedness higher than or equal
to the weight threshold. To tune the parameter α, we vary it in [0
1] in equation 3. Figure 2 presents performance measures in
different values of α. According to Figure 2 we can confirm that
the best value for parameter α is 0.2. In order to find the optimal
threshold for weight restrictions, we conduct different runs to
evaluate the impact of this parameter on retrieval performance.
Figure 3 presents the impact of modeling query context based on
weights equal to or higher than 0.7, 0.75, 0.8, 0.85 and 0.9. For
each value we perform conceptual re-ranking of results obtained
from query expansion and results confirm that the optimal weight
threshold to model query context is 0.9.
The corpus that is used to develop and test our approach is
provided within the context of the TREC [10] Medical Records
Track 2011 challenge and is composed of query set, patients’
records and relevance judgments. Each topic specifies a particular
disease/condition set and/or a particular treatment/intervention set.
The patients’ records are a set of de-identified electronic medical

The results show that our proposed approach (conceptual-DFR)
outperforms the baseline-Termbased run at all official measures
especially at P@5. This suggests the effectiveness of medical
query domain ontology for extracting associated diseases,
treatments and symptoms. The positive results also indicate the

model.

concepts related to query concept(s). Concepts in the query
context are weighted according to their semantic relatedness to the
query concept(s). The query context is exploited for re-ranking
clinical search results obtained from classical IR model. We
evaluate our proposed approach on the challenging ad-hoc
retrieval task of TREC medical records track. Results show that
our proposed approach improves the retrieval performance at all
the TREC’s official measures. The results suggest the
effectiveness of combining conceptual search using query context
modeling with standard term-based retrieval. Experimental results
also indicate the capability of query domain ontology in
expressing closely related concepts. For future work, we plan to
do the retrieval process based on calculating the relatedness of
query concepts with document’s keywords using definition
information and co-occurrence information.

We also evaluate the effectiveness of our approach after applying
rocchio’s query expansion mechanism. The DFR-QE run is based
on DFR-based sequential dependence model using rocchio’s
query expansion mechanism from Terrier (default values of
beta=0.4, 10 expansion documents and 40 expansion terms). This
run is performed using term-based representation of queries and
documents. The Conceptual-DFR-QE is based on re-ranking the
results obtained from our proposed query expansion and applying
rocchio’s query expansion mechanism. The conceptual query
expansion is performed by integrating the keyword-based query
context into DFR-based sequential dependence model using
keyword-based query context with α=0.2 and weight threshold of
0.9. The conceptual re-ranking is performed using the conceptual
representation of documents where documents’ scores are
calculated using eq. 3.

As Table 1 demonstrates, Terrier’s rocchio query expansion
mechanism (DFR-QE) improves the retrieval performance
compare to baseline. Our proposed approach (Conceptual-DFRQE) improves the results significantly at all the performance
measures compare to baseline. This run also improves the
retrieval performance at all the performance measures compared
to DFR-QE (MAP by 19.5%, R-prec by 13%, bpref by 23%, p@5
by 28% and p@10 by 19%). Results from conceptual runs foster
the effectiveness of combining the conceptual search based on
proposed query context modeling with DFR-based dependence IR
model.
