ABSTRACT
An important aspect of communication in Twitter (and other
Social Networks) is message propagation – people creating
posts for others to share. Although there has been work on
modelling how tweets in Twitter are propagated (retweeted),
an untackled problem has been who will retweet a message.
Here we consider the task of finding who will retweet a message posted on Twitter. Within a learning-to-rank framework, we explore a wide range of features, such as retweet
history, followers status, followers active time and followers
interests. We find that followers who retweeted or mentioned
the author’s tweets frequently before and have common interests are more likely to be retweeters.

RELATED WORK

The popularity of Twitter, easy access to data and the
unique characteristic of retweeting have made it a hot research domain recently. Related work can be divided into
predicting retweets and retweeting behavioral analysis.

INTRODUCTION

Twitter is a popular microblogging service which attracts
over 500 million registered users and generates over 340 million tweets daily1 . People not only consume information
but also publish or share opinions or stories themselves. An
interesting mechanism in Twitter is retweeting – re-posting
someone else’s tweet. Most studies in retweeting concentrate
on predicting whether a tweet will be retweeted [5, 13, 1] or
understanding retweeting behavior [11, 4, 18]. However, we
are still largely ignorant about who will retweet a post. We
1

call such people retweeters. Here, we consider the problem
of finding retweeters in Twitter.
Modelling who will retweet a post deepens our understanding of how information flows in Social Networks. These
factors can be a complex interaction between the message
content itself, the original author and the person who propagates that message. Understanding who will share a post
is of interest to advertisers and media companies. This is
clearly a hard task as much of the information necessary for
prediction is hidden from us, or changes over time.
Here, we treat finding retweeters as a ranking problem
which retrieves followers retweeting a certain post. We use
a standard machine learning approach to learn a ranking
function for followers that uses a range of features. These
features include: the retweet history of the original author,
the social status of her followers, when they are active and
their interests. We demonstrate that our ranking approach
using all features can achieve MAP significantly better than
a random baseline which ranks the followers randomly and
a baseline which ranks followers by the number of times she
retweeted the author’s previous tweets before. In particular,
we find that the retweet history and the similarity between
the content of the tweet and the posting times of followers
are most effective for finding retweeters.

2.1

Predicting Retweets

In Twitter, messages deemed important by the community
propagates through retweets. There is much work related to
predicting whether a tweet in general will be retweeted. Suh
et al. [16] firstly examined a number of features that might
affect retweetability of tweets using a large amount of data.
They found that, amongst content features, URLs and hashtags have strong relationships with retweetability. Petrovic et al. [13] used a machine learning approach based on
the passive-aggressive algorithm to predict whether a tweet
would be retweeted in the future. They found that the tweet
content, the number of times the author was listed, how
many followers they had and whether the author was verified
were useful features for this task. Hong et al. [5] proposed a
method to predict whether a tweet would be retweeted and
also estimated the number of times it would be retweeted.
Zaman et al. [19] used a collaborative filtering approach to

predict for a pair of users whether a tweet written by one will
be retweeted by the other user. They found that the identity of the source of the tweet and retweeter were the most
effective features for predicting future retweets. Naveed et
al. [12] trained a prediction model to forecast for a given
tweet its likelihood of being retweeted based on its contents.
They introduced and evaluated a method to determine the
‘interestingness’ of microblog messages. Their experimental
results showed that this interestingness made a message on
Twitter worth retweeting. Artzi et al. [1] proposed a model
for predicting the likelihood of responding which includes
retweeting and replying.

2.2

When retrieving retweeters, we consider the following feature families:

3.1.1

Retweet History (RH)

Intuitively, some follower fi who retweeted (mentioned) a
user u before is likely to retweet u’s tweets again. We develop
two features: the number of times fi previously retweeted
u’s tweets (called Num fRu) and the number of times fi
mentioned u before (called Num fMu). This captures the
idea that two users may talk to each other and so may be
more inclined to propagate posts in the future. We also
consider the situation when two users mutually repost each
other. We count the number of times u retweeted and mentioned fi ’s tweets before (called Num uRf and Num uMf
respectively) as two other features for our task. Finally,
some people (often spammers) only repost other people’s
information and hardly post original texts. We use the ratio
of a follower’s tweets which are retweets (or contain mention ‘@’), called Ratio retweet (Ratio mention), as two
features.

Retweeting Behavioral Analysis

Moving away from predicting retweets, researchers have
also studied broad characteristics of retweeting. boyd2 et
al. [4] interviewed Twitter users on the reasons why they
retweet, and on what they retweet the most. Yang and
Counts [17] constructed networks based on user name mentions when measuring how the network structure affected information diffusion in Twitter. Yang et al. [18] analyzed how
retweeting behaviors was influenced by factors such posting time. They found that almost 25.5% of tweets posted
by users are actually retweeted from friends who had blogs.
Macskassy and Michelson [10] studied a set of Twitter users
over a period of a month and sought to explain the individual
information diffusion behaviors, as represented by retweets.
They found that content based propagation models could
explain the majority of retweet behaviors they saw in their
data. Starbird et al. [15] examined microblogging information diffusion activity during the 2011 Egyptian political
uprisings. They demonstrated how remote individuals participated in Egypt’s 2011 revolution through low-risk, social
media- enabled activities. Comarela et al. [3] identified factors that influence users’ response or retweet probability.
They found previous response to the tweeter, the tweeters’ sending rate, the freshness of information, the length
of tweet could affect users’ response.

Features

3.1.2

Follower Status (FS)

Information propagation is often from higher status3 users
to lower status users [2]. We randomly investigated more
than 100,000 retweets and found only 38.8% of retweets
are from users posting fewer tweets to users posting more
tweets; only 23.8% of retweets are posted from users containing fewer followers to users containing more followers; only
0.04% retweets are from unverified users to verified users.
These statistics show that users with different social status
have different retweeting behavior. We include this information as follows: the number of tweets user fi has ever
written (called Posts), the number of followers user fi has
(called Followers), the number of friends user fi has (called
Friend), the times user fi has been listed (called Listed)
and whether fi is verified (called Verified).

3.1.3

Follower Active Time (FAT)

Twitter users do not often interact with other users (very)
late at night. Furthermore, posts made late at night are often not seen by other users the next day due to them being
replaced by more recent tweets4 . To explore this statement,
we considered which time users actually replied to other
users. After randomly sampling 10,000 tweets that were
replies, we found that only 12.4% of users replied to tweets
between the hours of 00:00 and 06:00.
We model this information using two features. The first
captures when two users are in the same timezone (called
Timezone). We use the proportion of fi ’s tweets posted
before which were in the same hour interval to the tweet
t’s posting time as another feature called PostTimeConsis. This feature could capture the consistency of follower’s
posting time habit to t’s posting time.

METHOD

Given a tweet t from user u and her followers F ollowers(u),
our goal is to learn a function F that estimates the likelihood
of follower fi (fi ∈ F ollower(u)) retweeting t in future. We
treat this as a ranking problem and find the top-k followers
who are most likely to retweet a given post. This is because
tweets might be retweeted by variable numbers of people
and potentially we might want to rank them. Note that this
could be treated as a classification problem without loss of
generality.
To generate a good function F which ranks F ollowers(u)
according to whether they are likely to be retweeters of a
given post, we investigate a wide range of features. We
develop features in a learning-to-rank scenario [7]. Learning
to rank is a data driven approach which incorporates a set
of features in a model for ranking task [8, 9]. Every follower
fi is tagged whether she retweeted t in training data. This
gives author-follower pairs. From these author-follower pairs
a set of features related to the possibility of being retweeters
is extracted.

3.1.4

Follower Interests (FI)

A follower retweeting a tweet might indicate some connection between the two people; for example, they might
share common interests (“we both love cats”), be having an
off-line relationship etc. This information can be a valuable hint when finding retweeters. We present a similarity

model to capture shared interests and represent the user fi ’s
previous tweets as a simple weighted bag-of-word of terms
(based on Tfidf score). We can then compute a cosine angle between the user fi ’s previous tweets and the tweet t
(based on vector space model [14]). We call this feature the
SimInterest. When calculating the value of feature SimInterest, for each pairs of tweet t and follower fi ’s previous
tweets, we filtered the top 100 high frequent words and the
words which appear less than 5 times in more than 6 millions
tweets in our collected data.

baseline, we note that followers who previously had a history of retweeting might do this in the future. Therefore, we
ranks followers by the number of times they retweeted the
author’s previous tweets before (called RPT ).

4.2.2

EXPERIMENTS

4.1

Dataset and Experimental setting

To the best of our knowledge, there is no annotated dataset
of retweeters in Twitter. Therefore, we created a new dataset
for this task5 . We randomly selected 500 English tweets
which had been retweeted at least once by the respective
author followers. Tweet posting times were from September 14th, 2012 to October 1st, 2012. Since retweeting is
time sensitive (half of retweeting occur within an hour, and
75% of retweeting under a day [6]) we rechecked these tweets
again after one day to investigate which followers retweeted
the original tweet. Due to time limitation of the Twitter
API and the large number of followers for popular users,
it is infeasible for us to collect all follower information for
each author. Therefore, we only collected 100 recent new
followers from all the followers of tweet authors. We also
collected 200 recent tweets of each follower. As previously
explained, we assigned a binary label to every follower indicating whether they retweeted a post. Note that some users
may not be available due to privacy concerns preventing us
from achieving total recall. Importantly, because we do not
exhaustively collect all follower information for each user, it
is possible that a tweet is retweeted by a user that we do
not have information for. This will also reduce overall recall.
Summary statistics of the data are listed in Table 1.

The author of this tweet was retweeted by a follower who
retweeted or mentioned the author’s tweets 30 times totally
in previous tweets. Our RH model ranks this follower in first
place.
Here is another example showing the usefulness of user

We use SVMRank when training our author retrieval model6 .
We use a linear kernel for training and report results for the
best setting of parameters. In order to avoid overfitting
the data we perform 10-fold cross-validation in our dataset.
There are several metrics that can be used to measure the
performance of ranking. In this paper, we use Mean Average
Precision (MAP) as the evaluation metric.

4.2.1

Examples

Here is an example showing the usefulness of user retweet
history:

4.2

Retrieval Performance

Our ranking methods use different feature families: Retweet
History, Follower Status, Follower Active Time and
Follower Interests (called RH, FS, FAT and FI respectively).
Table 2 shows retrieval performance according to which
family of related features we use. The main result is that
user similarity (Follower Interest, FI) is the most beneficial
information source, followed by retweeting history (RH) and
then social status of followers (Follower Status, FS). Information about active time of the follower is not useful for this
task. Finally, using all feature families together (called All )
achieves the best performance, improving MAP by 301.4%
over the Random and 25.6% over the PRT.
Next we consider in detail the effect of individual features
when finding retweeters in Twitter. Table 3 shows the results using individual features when ranking7 . We can see
that all the ranking methods based on the features from
Retweet History feature family yield significant improve
this task. We also found the feature PostTimeConsis
helps. Additionally, the effectiveness of SimInterest shows
most users retweet another user’s posts based on content.

Results
Baselines

We choose two baselines. The first one simply ranks followers randomly and we call it Random. For the second

The author of this tweet has a follower who retweeted this
post and in turn had posted often about music and performance as shown in previous tweets. This follower was ranked
higher by the FI model.

CONCLUSION

Finding retweeters in Twitter can help deliver information to other people more efficiently and effectively. This is
a new task and our results will open the way for follow-up research better understanding how Social Media works. In our
work we find the historical retweeting records of author and
followers, the followers’ status and the similarity between
the content of the tweet and followers’ previous tweets are
effective information for this task.

The MAP results of PRT and Num fRu ranking models
are different, since we use the weight of feature Num fRu
for PRT to rank followers directly and take this as a feature
for learning to rank in Num fRu model.

In the future our work is using new features to improve
the performance of finding retweeters. These may include
whether the intimate friends of follower retweet the certain
tweet, whether the location information of the tweets affects
the followers, etc.
