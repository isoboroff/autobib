ABSTRACT
We propose a method for ﬁnding impressive creators in online social network sites (SNSs). Many users are actively
engaged in publishing their own works, sharing visual content on sites such as YouTube or Flickr. In this paper, we
focus on the Japanese illustration-sharing SNS, Pixiv. We
implement an illustrator search system based on user impression categories. The impressions of illustrators are estimated from clues in the crowdsourced social-tag annotations
on their illustrations. We evaluated our system in terms of
normalized discounted cumulative gain and found that using feedback on motifs and impressions for illustrations of
relevant illustrators improved illustrator search by 11%.

1. INTRODUCTION
Many users are actively engaged in sharing visual content
via social network sites (SNSs) such as YouTube, Flickr,
and deviantART1 . In this paper, we focus on the Japanese
illustration-sharing SNS, Pixiv2 . On an illustration-sharing
SNS, users can publish their own illustrations. We can also
request illustrations from illustrators through the SNS, as
shown in Figure 1.

In existing illustrator search systems3 , users have to search
for illustrator candidates manually. If users ﬁnd suitable illustrators on the SNS, they can request access to their illustrations.
We propose a method of searching for illustrators on an
illustration-sharing SNS that is based on user impression
categories. Impressions of the illustrator’s work are estimated from the crowdsourced social-tag annotations on his/her
illustrations. We clarify the eﬀectiveness of the illustrator
ranking strategy using motifs and impressions. In addition,
to solve the problem of sparseness in input queries, we propose a query expansion method that uses feedback from the
motifs and impressions for illustrations of relevant illustrators.
In Section 2, we describe related work. In Section 3, we introduce our interface, investigate inter-annotator agreement
about selected impressions, and describe an experiment that
estimates impressions via SVM and decision tree (DT) involving crowdsourced clues. In Section 4, we evaluate our
ranking strategy that uses motifs and impressions as relevance feedback. We conclude our paper in Section 5.

RELATED WORK

For research into social tagging, Sun et al. [10] proposed
Tag-based Image Retrieval (TagIR), that is, the task of ranking images that match a given query tag in descending order
of relevance. To our knowledge, however, the task of ﬁnding
content creators has not been studied. The diﬃculty with
TagIR is that knowledge diversity leads to diﬀerent interpretations of the meaning of tags. In this work, we focus not
on the images (visual content) directly but on the creators
of visual works as retrieval targets. As we discuss in Section 3.2, diﬀerent users tend to annotate the visual works
of a particular creator in terms of a common set of tags.
That is, knowledge tends to be less diversiﬁed by focusing
on the creators, rather than on their work. Lee et al. [3]
considered a social tagging index as an essential user–tag

relationship, in the same way as traditional frameworks use
the relationship between documents and their terms. We
focus on the relationship between tags and the creator and
use it to propose a creator search framework.
When searching for people such as experts, Macdonald [5]
clariﬁed that dealing with topic drift is necessary to apply a
query expansion framework to the expert search. We apply
a relevance feedback technique to the creator search framework by focusing on relevant creators that have motifs. Liu
et al. [4] suggested that a relative expertise score is essential when seeking experts in community question answering.
In our framework, creators can be compared in terms of
12 impression dimensions. Sharma et al. [9] exploited the
Lists (user collection) features to infer the user’s attributes
in Twitter. We exploit social tags that are more generalized
to infer creator attributes.
In existing illustrator search services4 , illustrator proﬁles
are registered manually, which makes interactive searching
for potential illustrators diﬃcult. In our study, users can
search for promising illustrators through their impressions
on the SNS.

Impressions for Illustrator Search

We deﬁned 12 illustrator impressions (cute, beautiful, nice,
cool, funny, heartwarming, sexy, stylish, happy, digniﬁed,
formidable, and calm) by reference to social-tag annotations on 1,800 illustrations from Pixiv. We investigated
inter-annotator agreement (κ value) for these impressions
in terms of both illustrator and illustration. Four assessors
annotated the impressions for 28 illustrators and for 10 illustrations from each illustrator. The results are shown in
Figure 3. Inter-annotator agreement by illustrator is signiﬁcantly superior to agreement by illustration (two-tailed
t-test, signiﬁcance level 5% ). From this, we concluded that
impressions could be recognized clearly by looking at the
illustrations from the same illustrator. Of the 12, four impressions agreed either almost perfectly or substantially (0.6
< κ) and six impressions agreed moderately (0.4 < κ ≤ 0.6).

3.3

We propose an illustrator search framework that is based
on the motifs and impressions of illustrations published on
illustration-sharing SNSs. The interface is shown in Figure
25 . Users enter motifs and check the impressions of illustrators, and can compare impressions of illustrators using
a cobweb chart. Illustrator impressions are estimated from
the social-tag annotations on their illustrations, as described
in Section 3.3.

Ames et al. [1] suggest that organization for retrieval and
social communication are the key motivations for social tagging. In illustration-sharing SNSs, a variety of emerging motifs has begun to appear frequently and the social context
is changing according to the new trend. To estimate the
impressions of illustrations dynamically, we implement an
estimation framework based on machine learning (SVM[6]
and DT[7] in Weka6 ) using 427 crowdsourced social tags
that reﬂect impressions (called evaluation tags7 ). We prepared 3,300 items of illustrator data for training. For comparison, we also collected some general Japanese clues (705
adjectives, 2,321 adverbs, and 2,100 adjectival verbs) from a
morpheme dictionary UniDic8 . These features are summarized in Table 1. In addition, we implemented a rule-based

impression estimation framework, which used 520 clues that
were manually selected from 1,800 illustrations. We evaluated the systems using an accuracy measure and the test
data for 28 illustrators described in Section 3.2. The results are shown in Table 2, and show that crowdsourced
evaluation ([hyouka] in Japanese) tags are more eﬀective
in estimating impressions than the terms collected from a
dictionary, and based on their parts-of-speech. We also suggest the results with combined clues from crawdsourced tags
and from dictionary entries. For several impressions, the
machine learning based estimation with combined clues is
comparable to the manually coded rule-based estimation.

4.1 Expansion of Motifs and Impressions in
Social Tags with Relevance Feedback
Our system ranks illustrators by considering motifs and
impressions. Users specify motifs via an input query and
impressions via a checkbox, as illustrated in Section 3.1.
Query motifs are simply matched with social tags annotated
on the illustrations by the illustrator, and impressions are
estimated from the annotated social tags. Illustrators are
ranked according to the number of their illustrations that
match the motifs and impressions. We clarify experimentally the eﬀectiveness of the ranking strategy for the illustrators that combines motifs and impressions.
Social tags for a single motif, however, can be expressed
in a variety of styles, which may not be suﬃcient to match
an entered motif. Twelve of the impressions are also not
diﬀerentiated clearly, but are interrelated. To solve these
problems, we can use one of the query expansion methods—
namely, the relevance feedback approach of Rocchio[8].
We extend this idea by regarding the documents as illustrators and the terms as social tags. With this extension, we can ﬁnd more illustrators similar to relevant illustrators. The illustrators are re-ranked using the feedback
of tag weights, by expanding the social tags for relevant illustrators, and de-noising them on nonrelevant illustrators.

Discussion

In Table 4, the nDCG value improved for Tasks 10, 13,
19, and 20.
• In Task 10 and Task 19, by expanding the motifs for
relevant illustrators, users can ﬁnd the illustrators producing illustrations annotated by such tags and the
nDCG improves. The search task in Task 10 is “Search
illustrators who draw cool and strong robots.” In this
task, the query motif is “robots”, but the motif tags
are annotated with a variety of expressions such as
“mechanic” or “machine”.

4.2 Methodology
We (authors) prepared 20 illustrator search tasks in Table 3 and evaluated the ranking eﬀectiveness using normalized discounted cumulative gain (nDCG) [2]. The relevance
judgment is based on four grades A to D, depending on the
number of illustrations relevant to the task that illustrators
post (A, more than ﬁve; B, three or four; C, one or two; D,
none). The judge was conducted by the second author. We
compared three tag-expansion strategies (for motifs, for impressions, and for both) using relevance feedback [8] against
a baseline system, with illustrators ranked according to their
relevance regarding the motifs and impressions estimated
from social tags.

• In Task 13 and Task 20, the search tasks are slightly
ambiguous, such as “Search illustrators who draw impressive story comics” and “Search illustrators who
draw calm people or animals”. By ﬁnding and specifying more concrete information requirements for topranked illustrators, users can ﬁnd more relevant illustrators and the nDCG will improve.
On the other hand, nDCG10 is slightly decreased in Tasks
5, 11, 14, and 15.

4.3 Results

• In Tasks 5, 11, and 15, almost all top-ranked illustrators are relevant before the relevance feedback. In
these cases, motifs and impression queries expanded
excessively and the nDCG decreased.

Results are shown in Table 4. We ﬁnd that the nDCG
value improved by a signiﬁcant 11%, and the motif-tag expansion contributed to this improvement.

• In Task 14, nDCG5 improved with motif expansion.
On the other hand, the nDCG decreased with the im-

pression expansion, because “cute” or “funny” social
tags are expanded in spite of illustrators who draw the

it as the user’s own choice whether relevance feedback
should be applied or not.

5. CONCLUSION
In this work, we propose a framework for ﬁnding content
creators via motifs and impressions, which are estimated
from the social-tag annotations on their works. The main
contributions in our work are summarized as follows.
1. We propose a framework to ﬁnd impressive contents
creators by using social tags in illustration-sharing SNSs.
2. We specify impressions for the illustrator search and
experiment with the estimation eﬀects of crowdsourced
clues.
3. We clarify that re-ranking with relevance feedback is
useful in ﬁnding relevant illustrators to be disambiguated
or in de-noising social tags.
In future work, we plan to apply this framework to SNS
services for diﬀerent visual content, such as movies, art works,
and photographs.
