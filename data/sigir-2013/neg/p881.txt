ABSTRACT

Google Trends1 and Foursquare [11]. However, little work has been
done on analyzing query log from the spatiotemporal perspective.
Although some admixture topic models [2] have been proposed
to accommodate the demands of analyzing timestamped or GPSlabeled data, to the best of our knowledge, none of them supports
discovering topics by considering different spatiotemporal patterns
simultaneously. However, in the field of query log analysis, it is
critical to model the existence of diverse spatiotemporal patterns.
For instance, a topic about Terrorism may widely exist from the
spatial perspective and lasts for a long time period from the temporal perspective. In contrast, a topic about Storm Sandy may be
primarily related to the coastal regions of the United States and has
a relatively short longevity. Besides the existence of diverse spatiotemporal patterns, query log data have some unique features such
as query words, URLs, timestamps, search sessions, etc. These information should be seamlessly integrated for discovering the web
search topics from query log.
To handle the aforementioned challenges, we propose the Spatiotemporal Search Topic Model (SSTM) to discover the latent topics from query log and capture their diverse spatiotemporal patterns simultaneously. To the best of our knowledge, the SSTM is
the first model that accommodates a variety of spatiotemporal patterns in a unified fashion. We carry out large-scale experiments and
the experimental results show that the SSTM outperforms several
state-of-the-arts in terms of perplexity as well as in the tasks such
as location prediction and time predication. The remainder of the
paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the related work is reviewed. Section 3 discusses the spatiotemporal patterns. Section
4 presents the SSTM and details its parameter inference method.
Section 5 presents experimental results, and conclusions are provided in Section 6.

Mining the latent topics from web search data and capturing their
spatiotemporal patterns have many applications in information retrieval. As web search is heavily influenced by the spatial and temporal factors, the latent topics usually demonstrate a variety of spatiotemporal patterns. In the face of the diversity of these patterns,
existing models are increasingly ineffective, since they capture only
one dimension of the spatiotemporal patterns (either the spatial or
temporal dimension) or simply assume that there exists only one
kind of spatiotemporal patterns. Such oversimplification risks distorting the latent data structure and hindering the downstream usage
of the discovered topics. In this paper, we introduce the Spatiotemporal Search Topic Model (SSTM) to discover the latent topics
from web search data with capturing their diverse spatiotemporal
patterns simultaneously. The SSTM can flexibly support diverse
spatiotemporal patterns and seamlessly integrate the unique features in web search such as query words, URLs, timestamps and
search sessions. The SSTM is demonstrated as an effective exploratory tool for large-scale web search data and it performs superiorly in quantitative comparisons to several state-of-the-art topic
models.

INTRODUCTION

We review some recent related work in this section. In [1], a
framework for quantifying the spatial variation of search queries is
developed on complete Yahoo query log. The Topic-Over-Time
model [14] is proposed to associate each topic with a continuous distribution over timestamps. In [4], the authors proposed a
model for the monitoring topic and vocabulary evolution over documents. In [16], LPTA is proposed to exploit the periodicity of the
terms as well as term co-occurrences. Wang et al. [13] proposed
a topic model to capture the relationships between locations and
words in news and blogs. Yin et al. [15] studied the problem of
discovering geographic topics from GPS-associated tweets. Sizov
et al. [12] proposed models for characterization of social media
by combining text features with spatial knowledge. Eisenstein et

With the rapid growth of web search data, there is a great demand
for developing effective text mining models to analyze search engine query log, since discovering the web search topics and capturing their spatiotemporal patterns are vital for applications such as

clicked URLs of this query. The location information is not readily
available in query log, we employ the method in [9] to extract the
locations l and obtain the latitudes llat and longitudes llon of the
locations via a geographic dictionary. The question mark indicates
that the corresponding element may not exist for some log entries.
In web search, the queries are not independent from each other.
The users usually submit search queries consecutively as a session
to satisfy a single information need. We utilize the method in [7]
to segment query log into search sessions. Finally, we group each
user’s log entries together as a document and then organize each
document via sessions.
The generative story of SSTM is presented in Algorithm 1. We
assume that each user has a topic distribution and each topic is related to a specific spatiotemporal pattern. When conducing web
search to satisfy an information need, the user first decides the topic
and then selects some query words according to the chosen topic.
For each search session, the user needs to decide whether to click
some URLs. If so, the clicked URLs are generated according to
the chosen topic as well. Since the information within a session
is coherent and is used to satisfy the same information need, we
constrain that the information in the same session shares the same
topic. Finally, the spatiotemporal information such as the timestamps and the locations (or the latitudes and longitudes) is generated based on the spatiotemporal pattern of the chosen topic.

al. [3] proposed a multi-level generative model that reasons about
lexical variation across different geographic regions. Hao et al. [5]
proposed the location-topic model to mine location-representative
knowledge from a collection of travelogues. Hong et al. [6] presented an algorithm by modeling diversity in tweets based on topical diversity, geographical diversity, and an interest distribution of
the user. In [10], a probabilistic approach is proposed to model the
subtopic themes and spatiotemporal theme patterns simultaneously.
With the popularity of applying topic modeling to spatial, temporal or even spatiotemporal information, few prior work has been
done on analyzing web search data by jointly modeling diverse spatiotemporal patterns. Hence, the major distinction of the proposed
SSTM is its capability of discovering web search topics while capturing their diverse spatiotemporal patterns simultaneously.

SPATIOTEMPORAL PATTERNS

In this section, we review the spatial temporal patterns that are
used in existing work. The existing spatial patterns can be broadly
divided into two categories: the local pattern (Sl ) and the global
pattern (Sg ) [12, 13]. The logic behind this categorization is that
some topics demonstrate geographic locality while the others do
not. Specifically, Sg assumes that each topic is related to some
locations and the geographic distance between the locations is not
considered while Sl assumes that topics have geographic locality
and each topic is related to a specific area on the map. The existing temporal patterns can be broadly classified into three types: the
periodic pattern (Tp ), the background pattern (Tg ) and the bursty
pattern (Tb ) [8, 16]. A periodic topic is one that repeats in regular intervals; a background topic is one covered uniformly over the
entire period; a bursty topic is a transient topic that is intensively
covered only in a certain time period. We now present the spatiotemporal patterns that will be used in this paper. Assume that we
have the spatial pattern set S and the temporal pattern set T from
the existing work, we create a set of spatiotemporal patterns P by
applying the Cartesian product on S and T . In this way, we get
very diverse spatiotemporal patterns, which are presented in Table
1. Note that the spatiotemporal pattern proposed in [10] is captured
by p2 in Table 1.

4.2 Parameter Inference
We proceed to discuss a sampling method for the parameter inference of SSTM. The joint likelihood of the observed query words,
the URLs and the spatiotemporal information with the hyperparameters is listed as follows:

P (w, u, t, l, z|α, β, δ, X, Y) =
P (u|z, δ, X)P (w|z, β)P (l|z, Y)P (t|z)P (z|α).

(1)

The probability of generating the query words w in the corpus is
given as follows:

4.1 Description of SSTM
We represent each query log entry in a format as follows:
{uid, w, t, (l, llat , llon )? , u? }
Here uid is the user identifier, w is the word vector for the query,
t is the timestamp of the query, (l, llat , llon )? is a vector of triplets
where l is the names of the locations, llat and llon represent the
latitudes and longitudes of the corresponding locations, u? is the

KU

session and Niu is the number of u in the ith session. Similarly, we
can derive the remaining conditional probabilities when the corresponding topic is related to other spatiotemporal patterns such as
p2 , p3 , ..., p6 . For the sake of simplicity and efficiency, we update
the distribution parameters of the bursty pattern, the periodic pattern and the local pattern after each iteration of the sampling procedure. For example, we update the Gaussian distribution of the
bursty pattern by the sample mean and sample variance as follows:

The conditional probability of generating the temporal information
t given the topic z can be written as:
p(t|z) = p(IzT = 0)p (t|z)+
p(IzT = 1)p (t|z) + p(IzT = 2)p (t|z),

The background pattern p (t|z) is modeled by a uniform distribution. In p (t|z), te and ts are the newest and the oldest timestamps
in the query log. The bursty pattern p (t|z) is modeled by a Gaussian distribution. The periodic pattern p (t|z) is modeled as a
mixture of Gaussian distributions. In p (t|z), n is the period id,

In this section, we evaluate the SSTM on the query log of a major commercial search engine in the United States. The dataset
contains 1,200,945 search queries that were submitted by 10,213
users. After carrying out the session derivation process, we obtain
520,131 search sessions.

5.1 Perplexity Comparison
We first evaluate SSTM by the quantitative metric of perplexity.
The baselines we choose are summarized as follows: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [2], Topics-Over-Time model (TOT)[14], Location Aware Topic Model (LATM)[13], Geodata in Folksonomies
(GeoFolk)[12], Spatiotemporal Theme Pattern model (STTP) [10]
and Latent Periodic Topic Analysis (LPTA)[16]. Perplexity measures the ability of a model to generalize to unseen data and better
generalization performance is indicated by a lower perplexity. We
compare the models by a ten-fold cross validation. Figure 1(a) illustrates the average perplexity for each model when the number of
topics is set to different values. We can see that the STTM provides
significantly better fit for the data than the baselines. For instance,
when the number of topics is 600, the perplexity of LDA, TOT,
LATM, GeoFolk, STTP and LPTA are 14220, 9986, 9601, 9072,
5569 and 6401 while the perplexity of SSTM is 1423.

If topic z is a global pattern, we model that spatial information
by a Multinomial distribution over the locations. If topic z is a
local pattern, we model the spatial information as a 2-dimensional
Gaussian distribution over the latitude and longitude:

After combining the aforementioned formula terms, applying Bayes
rule and folding terms into the proportionality constant, the conditional probability of assigning the kth topic for the ith session can
be determined by a set of formulas. For instance, if the topic k is
related to the spatiotemporal pattern p1 in Table 1, the conditional
probability is defined as follows:

5.2 Location Prediction
Geographical locations can be used to predict users’ behaviors
and uncover users’ interests and therefore it is potentially invaluable for many perspectives, such as behavior targeting and online
advertisements. In this subsection, we focus on the task of location
prediction. Our goal is to predict the location for a new search session based on the words and URLs in the session and the user’s information. In this experiment, we filter out the original geographic
information from each session and the original geographic information is utilized as the ground truth. For each new session, we
predict its location as l̂d . We calculate the Euclidean distance between the predicted value and the ground truth locations and average them over the whole test set. For all the models, we adopt a
ten-fold cross validation setting and the numbers reported here are
averaged across different folds. The experimental result is shown
in Figure 1(b). We can see that LATM and GeoFolk demonstrate

relatively high error because they only captures the spatial information. By considering both the spatial and the temporal information,
STTP achieves better performance in location prediction, although
it only captures one kind of spatiotemporal pattern. By capturing
the diverse spatiotemporal patterns, SSTM further reduces the error
of location prediction. For instance, when the number of topics is
1000, the error of LATM, GeoFolk and STTP are 154km, 132km
and 121km while the error of SSTM is 110km.

5.3 Time Prediction
Another interesting feature of SSTM is the capability of predicting the timestamps given the textual information in a search session. This task also provides another opportunity to quantitatively
compare SSTM against the models that capture the temporal information such as TOT, STTP and LPTA. We measure their ability
of predicting the date given the query terms in a session. We use
5,000 held-out search sessions as the evaluation data and then evaluate each model’s ability to predict the date of a search session. The
result is presented in Figure 1(c). SSTM demonstrates the highest
date prediction accuracy. For example, when the number of topics
is set to 1000. The error of SSTM is 7.73 days while those of TOT,
STTP and LPTA are 14.87, 13.26 and 13.97 days.

CONCLUSION

Search engine query log usually has a mixture of latent topics,
which exhibit diverse spatiotemporal patterns. Discovering the latent topics from query log and capturing their spatiotemporal patterns are critical for many applications in information retrieval.
In this paper, we develop the Spatiotemporal Search Topic Model
(SSTM), which explains the generation of web search topics and a
variety of spatiotemporal patterns simultaneously. We evaluate the
SSTM against several strong baselines on a commercial search engine query log. Experimental results show that the SSTM provides
better fit for the latent structure of query log data. We also demonstrate that SSTM can serve as the basis for higher level tasks, such
as predicting the location and time of web search behaviors. In future work, we plan to apply the SSTM for applications such as user
profiling and personalized spatiotemporal web search.
