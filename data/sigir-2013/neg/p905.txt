ABSTRACT

popularity. Second, the role of the web as a primary source
of up-to-date information becomes increasingly important,
which leads to a significant portion of pages becoming useless
several days after their creation. A proper understanding of
conditions that cause traffic decay of a page may enable us
to appropriately detect and remove lifeless content from a
search engine index, thus reducing computational resources
needed to process a query.
In this paper, we provide a large-scale temporal analysis
of web traffic by examining the stream of visits to web pages
from users in a European country, employing the browsing
log from a popular toolbar. In this study we focus on dynamical activity profiles of web pages whose lifespan is limited
to a short period of activity spike. We define activity profile
of a page as the time series of its daily visits count.
A possible approach to the analysis of the temporal activity is splitting the whole variety of observed time series into
a limited number of patterns. We build a multiclass classifier trained on a manually annotated dataset of activity
time series. Each time series is judged as belonging to one
of the following five categories: the four spike patterns corresponding to the presence or absence of significant activity
before and after the peak moment and the case of a temporal profile which does not look like a spike. We apply the
obtained classifier to a large-scale dataset of pages and use
their predicted labels as estimates of their popularity patterns. These estimates enable us to study the dependence
of web page activity profiles on different factors, such as the
second-level domain of a page and the topic of the domain.
We observe a noticeable connection between the popularity pattern of a page and the topic of its domain. For each
of the four spike patterns, we extract topics with the highest
fraction of the considered spike pattern (measured against
frequency in the whole dataset). The obtained results can
mostly be well explained and look intuitive given the common knowledge about the user browsing behavior.
Encouraged by these observations, we train several multiclass classifiers that predict the (estimated) popularity pattern of a page by (1) the topic of its domain, (2) its URL’s
tokens, and (3) prior distribution over popularity patterns
for the pages with the same domain. The obtained results
argue that the temporal popularity profile of a newly discovered web page may be somewhat accurately predicted by its
URL. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study devoted to the temporal popularity patterns of Internet pages.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The
next section is a review of related works in social media domain. We describe the data we use for designing activity

With the ever-increasing speed of content turnover on the
web, it is particularly important to understand the patterns
that pages’ popularity follows. This paper focuses on the
dynamical part of the web, i.e. pages that have a limited
lifespan and experience a short popularity outburst within
it. We classify these pages into five patterns based on how
quickly they gain popularity and how quickly they lose it.
We study the properties of pages that belong to each pattern
and determine content topics that contain disproportionately high fractions of particular patterns. These developments are utilized to create an algorithm that approximates
with reasonable accuracy the expected popularity pattern of
a web page based on its URL and, if available, prior knowledge about its domain’s topics.

INTRODUCTION

A lot of effort has been put recently into understanding
the dynamical aspects of collective attention on the web. A
number of papers were devoted to the analysis and prediction of information diffusion, evaluating it in terms of user
influence [1] and popularity of different pieces of content in
social media, such as topics [9], blog posts [4], links [1, 7],
and news [10].
From a search engine perspective, it would be useful to
study the global activity dynamics of web pages, that is, the
patterns that the total traffic of a single page can follow.
First, some state-of-the-art crawling methods employ user
browsing behavior while optimizing their policies [6]. We
believe the performance of such crawling policies may be improved by incorporating the prediction of new pages’ future

countries.
We extract records made in the 80-day period from August
27, 2012 to November 14, 2012. For each visited URL in the
log, we calculate the number of hits the URL received on
each of those 80 days. The obtained time series represent
the temporal activity profiles we study.
We filter the dataset by imposing two conditions. First,
we remove all pages that have non-zero visits on the first day
of the considered time frame. Those pages are likely to have
been created before the time period we examine, making us
unable to analyze the beginning of their lifespan. In particular, this filters out the already popular web pages, allowing
us to focus on the short-lived pages that form dynamical
part of the Web. Second, we remove pages whose maximal
activity does not reach 100 hits per day. This allows us to
filter out non-popular pages, leaving only the most important content for the study. In total, the collected dataset
describes activity profiles of approximately 3.1M web pages.

and 4 respectively. In Section 5 we describe the effect of domain topics on their page popularity patterns. We describe
results of prediction of popularity patterns in Section 6. Section 7 concludes the paper.

RELATED WORK

There is little work on the analysis of the popularity dynamics of web pages. In [8] Radinsky et al. propose a physical model that captures popularity variation of a query, a
document, and a query-document pair. However, their study
deals with traffic from a particular search engine only, which
may be biased. Furthermore, the authors focus on modeling
and predicting future popularity, while our task focuses on
analyzing the distribution of popularity patterns.
In [11] Yang et al. performed a clustering of two sets of
time series, first one quantifying mentions of popular phrases
in news sources and the second one measuring appearance
of hashtags in Twitter, both using hour granularity. In [5]
authors cluster time series of Twitter hashtags usage at day
granularity relying on two factors: the portion of activity
before the peak day and the portion of activity after it. The
results obtained in the two papers are rather similar and
capture the four types of spikes corresponding to the presense of absense of significant activity before and after the
peak moment. Relying on these results, we propose a classification algorithm to determine the types of patterns that
the temporal series under consideration follow.

TEMPORAL PATTERNS OF PAGE LIFE

This section describes the particular classes of temporal
activity patterns that we distinguish in our study. Both
the results in the previous works and our own observations
confirm the validity of the following five-types classification
model. The first four types represent different types of activity spike with a pronounced single peak. The slope of
a spike before the peak can be either sharp (a quick rise
of popularity in one or two days) or soft (the activity rises
steadily throughout a longer period of time). Similarly, the
slope of a spike after the peak can be light or substantial.
Different combinations of slope types before and after the
peak form the four types of spikes: (1) sharp rise, light tail
, (2) sharp rise, substantial tail
, (3) soft rise, light
tail
, (4) soft rise, substantial tail

represents profiles that (5) do not look like a spike. This includes several pronounced peaks, or even a period of stable
user attention strictly limited to a certain period of time.
In [5], Lehman et al. proposed to cluster the temporal
profiles of user attention by projecting them onto the space
of the following two factors: the portion of activity before
the peak day and the portion of activity after that. Unfortunately, this approach does not suit well the case of web
pages, which are not necessarily very popular within our
study and thus their activity profiles are noisier and allow
for more variety within each of the spike types (see the distribution of activity profiles in the space of those two factors
on Fig. 1).
Instead, we perform a multiclass classification as follows.
We manually examine a sample of 1377 URLs, annotating
their activity profiles with five labels (1)-(5) described above.
We then train a Friedman’s gradient boosting decision tree
model [2] on the obtained judged dataset, extracting the
significant properties of the daily visits graphs to use as features. We used 12 features, with the most significant three
being: the fraction of visits that happen 3 days after the
peak and later, the time difference between the first visit to
the page and its peak day, and the fraction of visits before
the peak day.
The classes 3 and 4 (soft rise case) are rather rare, constituting approximately 1.5% and 0.5% respectively in a random sample. As a result, the trained algorithm is biased to
detect them even less often than they occur. We overcome
this problem as follows. After the first round of annotating a random sample and training the algorithm, we use the
obtained algorithm to filter the whole database for URLs
that are likely to fall into classes 3 and 4. After that, we
annotate this particular sample in order to obtain a better
representation of the rare classes. In total, we annotated
408, 149, 170, 65, and 585 profiles falling into classes 1 to 5
respectively.

error types, and is not sensitive to highly unbalanced distribution of prior class probabilities. The value of MAUC
averaged over test for 10-fold cross validation is 0.89 for our
classification model.
We then apply the classification model to the whole dataset
and treat the time series-based predictions as the actual pattern types. As a result, we are able to analyze the pattern
types of 3.1M URLs in the context of their domain topic
and other properties as explained in the next sections. See
Tab. 3 for statistics of pattern distribution over the dataset
and Fig. 2 for the distribution of activity portions before
and after the peak for different popularity patterns.

DOMAIN TOPICS

In this section we study the distribution of pages popularity patterns conditioned by different topics of their domains.
For this purpose, we use a public database of domains manually categorized by their topics for a popular search engine.
We train a Naive Bayes classifier on this data by employing unigram features. For each page whose activity profile
is represented in our dataset, we define its second-level domain and apply the obtained topic classifier to the content
pages of that domain. If some topic covers a greater portion of that pages, we attribute the whole domain to that
topic. After that, we mark out 154 most frequent topics
according to the number of pages of our dataset whose domain is attributed to these topics. Covering about 87% of
content, they are employed as domain topic features in the
classification tasks of the next section.
For each of the four patterns of spikes, we rank these 154
topics according to the frequency of that pattern within their
pages. We present the top topics of the four lists in Tab. 1.
As we see, the first profile is more typical for news pages
that are meant for a short-term people attention, such as
sport events, concerts, etc. The traffic of these pages is attributed to the event moment, it rises and falls quickly. The
second pattern is typical for pages, which appear on large
entertainment portals devoted to fun or hobby. They gather
a high traffic right after their creation and keep popular for
some time. The third pattern is determined by rapid fall of
popularity after a long rise. It is typical for pages devoted to
upcoming events, the most striking example is weather forecast. Another example is a car ads, usually gaining traffic
until the car is sold. The third pattern is not well separated from the fourth pattern, which is more frequent for
blog posts and other social media content, whose popularity
rises relatively slowly till its peak and then falls gradually.
We also approach the following research question: how
the frequencies of the five popularity patterns among pages
within different domains correlate with each other? For this
purpose, we created a dataset of second-level domains (referred to as ”small dataset”) that are represented by at least
10 web pages in our dataset of activity profiles. This dataset
covers 95.3% of the whole dataset of activity profiles. We

obtained before the actual pattern is known: (1) the distribution of topics on page’s domain, (2) tokens of page’s URL,
and (3) prior distribution over popularity patterns on page’s
domain. We show that a significant amount of information
is indeed contained in the aforementioned factors, and build
a classification algorithm that allows to predict the activity

five domain features over the small dataset. This matrix
captures which pairs of patterns are collaborative and which
are competitive in the context of their domain. We see, for
example, the largest negative correlation of the first and the
firth patterns, which means that short-term and long-term
web pages are well-separated at the level of their domains.

Encouraged by results of the previous section, we trained
several classifiers that predict web page popularity pattern
by its URL. We used the following three groups of features:
(1) topics of page’s second-level domain (binary ones), (2)
weights of Naive Bayesian classifier trained on URL tokens,
and (3) the five domain features. The features of (1) and
(3) groups are described in the previous section. We trained
Friedman’s gradient boosting decision tree models [2] with
10-fold cross validation on (1) the dataset of activity profiles,
and (2) the small dataset by employing different combinations of feature groups. Performance of the obtained models
is reported in Tab. 4.

CONCLUSION

In this paper, we examined different patterns that temporal activity profiles of web pages’ traffic can follow. We
proposed an algorithm to automatically classify the activity profiles that have a short-term popularity spike into five
different patterns depending on how quickly they gain and
lose popularity. The algorithm is subsequently used to conduct a large-scale analysis. The main contribution of this
paper is the examination of the degree of depedence that
