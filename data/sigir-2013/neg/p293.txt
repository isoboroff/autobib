ABSTRACT

1. INTRODUCTION

The interest of users in handheld devices is strongly related
to their location. Therefore, the user location is important,
as a user context, for news article recommendation in a mobile environment. This paper proposes a novel news article
recommendation that reﬂects the geographical context of
the user. For this purpose, we propose the Explicit Localized Semantic Analysis (ELSA), an ESA-based topical representation of documents. Every location has its own geographical topics, which can be captured from the geo-tagged
documents related to the location. Thus, not only news articles but locations are also represented as topic vectors. The
main advantage of ELSA is that it stresses only the topics
that are relevant to a given location, whereas all topics are
equally important in ESA. As a result, geographical topics
have diﬀerent importance according to the user location in
ELSA, even if they come from the same article. Another
advantage of ELSA is that it allows a simple comparison of
the user location and news articles, because it projects both
locations and articles onto an identical space composed of
Wikipedia topics. In the evaluation of ELSA with the New
York Times corpus, it outperformed two simple baselines of
Bag-Of-Words and LDA as well as two ESA-based methods.
Rt10 of ELSA was improved up to 46.25% over other methods, and its NDCG@k was always higher than those of the
others regardless of k.

Content-based news article recommendation aims to offer news articles to a reader based on his/her interests. To
reﬂect the interests of a speciﬁc reader into article recommendation, the interests are predicted from the user proﬁle
that is a collection of articles he/she has read in the past or
explicit information about the reader such as age and gender. This kind of user proﬁle is static or at least almost
static. The proﬁle remains same regardless of the user location, even if a large number of users of handheld devices
(i.e. smart phone or tablet PC) access online news providers
anywhere, and their interests depend on their location.
The fact that the interests of a user are strongly related to
their location, implies that his/her geographical context is
important for localized news article recommendation. For
instance, assume that a user is reading an article “After
Delays, Wireless Web Comes to Parks” of The New York
Times. This article delivers news about establishing wireless
networks at the prominent parks in New York city. Therefore, it has two major topics, a new facility of public parks
and a company that won a contract for the wireless network service. The people who are strolling at a public park
will focus on the former, while those working at Wall Street
would prefer the latter.
The key of news article recommendation is obviously a
representation of the articles. Word frequencies or topics are
the most widely used representation of articles [11, 18], but
recently, topic representation is preferred because a topic is
a good proxy for article contents [23]. For instance, Wang
and Blei proposed a collaborative topic model using Latent
Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to recommend scientiﬁc articles
[2]. Egozi et. al [5] projected articles onto a topic space constructed with Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) [7]. In ESA,
each Wikipedia concept is regarded as a possible topic, and
an article is represented as a topic vector with Wikipedia
concepts. Because Wikipedia has a large volume of concepts, articles can be expressed eﬃciently and accurately.
On the other hand, such topic representations of articles are
geo-neutral. Therefore, a topic model that reﬂects the geographical context of a user is needed to localize an article
recommendation.
When the location at which a user is standing is the only
information available for the user proﬁle, the geographical
context of a user is equivalent to the geographical context of
his/her location. The geographical context of a location can
also be expressed as a topic vector, because most locations
have their own geographical topics that are deﬁned as spatially coherent meaningful themes [25]. Most topic models

Zheng et al. proposed the user-centered collaborative location and activity ﬁltering (UCLAF) to recommend tourism
spots and activities [27]. In UCLAF, the similar users of
a speciﬁc user are obtained based on their GPS trajectories and activities at tourism spots. UCLAF recommends
tourism spots for the user by analyzing similar users. CityVoyager system proposed by Takeuchi and Sugimoto [22] uses
the shops previously visited by a user to recommend new
shops for him/her. Ye et al. proposed Geo-Measured Friendbased Collaborative Filtering (GM-FCF) to recommend places
such as stores, movie theaters, etc [24]. The recommendation by GM-FCF is made using the places visited by his/her
friends in the social network. GM-FCF ranks the places by
their physical distance from his/her location. Yu and Chang
suggested a tour planning system [26]. This system also recommends sightseeing spots, hotels, and restaurants based on
user’s location.
As shown in these studies, the user’s location helps recommendation systems improve their performance. This is
because it reveals valuable information of the user. This was
recently taken into account for news recommendation. GeoFeed is a location-aware news feed system [1]. This system
provides its users with the news that are spatially related
with the users. The spatial relationship between the user
and a news in GeoFeed is determined using the distances
from his/her to the locations tagged in the news. Mokbel et
al. employed user locations to recommend local news [14].
In their study, they considered the distance between the
user and location in which the news article was published.
Although these studies proved the feasibility of their idea
by implementing practical localized recommender systems,
only the physical attributes of the user location was considered but its latent attributes are ignored. To the best of our
knowledge, no study has used the latent attributes of the
user locations in news article recommendation.

proposed for extracting geographical topics from a location
identify topics actually from a set of geo-tagged documents
associated with the location [13]. Nevertheless, they have a
problem in that the geo-tagged documents include not only
the topics that are related directly to the location but also
some other topics that have no relationship with the location.
This paper proposes a novel method for the topical representation of documents, Explicit Localized Semantic Analysis (ELSA). ELSA basically represents news articles as topic
vectors considering the geographical context of a location.
It inherits all the advantages of ESA as an extension of ESA,
but overcomes the drawback in that ESA is geo-neural. That
is, the topic vectors of the articles in ELSA are biased to
the geographical context of the location. For this purpose,
ELSA estimates the distribution of local topics for a given
user location. All topics for a location are found from the
geo-tagged documents of the location, but they are generally dependent on one another. For instance, the topics ‘FC
Barcelona’ and ‘Lionel Messi’ are somehow dependent from
each other, as they are related to Camp Nou, a football stadium in Barcelona. To express the topic dependency, the
link information within Wikipedia concepts is adopted. All
Wikipedia concepts, which are related to the location, are
expressed as a graph with their link information. The hub
nodes of this topic dependency graph are the actual local
topics associated with the location.
Another advantage of ELSA is that it can be used to represent not only articles but also locations. This is because
the user location is also expressed with the topics from a set
of geo-tagged documents retrieved with that location. That
is, the articles and locations are all represented as vectors in
identical topic space. This leads to a simple comparison of
articles and locations, and eﬃcient recommendation of the
articles that are relevant to the user location.
A series of experiments were carried out to verify the recommendation performance of ELSA. In the experiments, the
articles were recommended for ﬁfteen locations in three distinguished categories: Airport, Baseball stadium, and National park. The New York Times corpus was used as the
recommendation candidates, and the performance of ELSA
was compared with four other methods: Bag-of-Words, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [2], Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) [7], and Probabilistic Explicit Semantic Analysis
(PESA) [21]. According to the experimental results, ELSA
outperformed the others in both Rt10 (Rating of Top 10)
[15] and NDCG@k. These results highlight the eﬀectiveness
of ELSA in the localized article recommendation.

2.2 Geographical Topic Model
A location is described physically by its longitude and
latitude. This is because it is diﬃcult to transform a location into other forms but the coordinate of the longitude
and latitude, even though most locations have their own geographical context and the context can be expressed with
topics at these locations. For instance, the topics ‘shopping’
at a department store and ‘trip’ at a sightseeing spot describe their locations well. One of the eﬀorts to extract the
geographical topics of a location is the geographical topic
model. Therefore, range of geographical topic models have
been proposed [20, 28].
The main issue in geographical topics is how to associate
topics with locations. Eisenstein et al. proposed a generative model to determine the topics of a set of geo-tagged
documents and the regions corresponding to the topics simultaneously [6]. In order to determine them simultaneously, they assumed that a document is generated from two
latent variables of geographical topics and regions. Yin et
al. proposed Latent Geographical Topic Analysis (LGTA)
[25] to solve the same problem. The contribution of LGTA
is that it allows geographical topics to be associated with
multiple regions. Hong et al. proposed a generative model
to discover geographical topics in the tweet stream [9]. They
made a similar assumption using the above-mentioned methods, but the idiosyncracy of their method comes from the
fact that the method attempts to reﬂect the preferences of

RELATED WORK

2.1 Localized Recommendation
The popularity of handheld devices with a GPS makes the
user location available for various kinds of recommendations
[12, 17, 19]. Most previous studies on localized recommendation have focused on the physical attributes of locations.
Dao et al. proposed a context-aware collaborative ﬁltering
for location-based advertising [4]. In their study, the item
scores for a speciﬁc user are determined by considering user’s
location. That is, the user-item matrix of this method is expanded with the user locations. Thus, the user similarity
can be obtained using the items shared by other users at
the same location.

twitter users and the dependency between regions and topics.
These geographical topic models were applied successfully
to geographical topic discovery. On the other hand, it is
diﬃcult to apply them to news article recommendation. In
order to recommend articles for a speciﬁc location, all the
topics at the location should be identiﬁed ﬁrst. However,
the topic models for topic discovery try to ﬁnd major topics
for the location. As a result, some topics are ignored, even if
they deliver some information for the location. Thus, a topic
model that utilizes all topics of a given location is needed.
One candidate to represent a location with all its topics is Probabilistic Explicit Semantic Analysis (PESA) [21].
PESA is a probabilistic topic model based on Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) [7], and is designed to compare locations with their topics. For this, it maps locations onto
a topic space spanned by Wikipedia concepts. Because all
Wikipedia concepts are employed in representing locations,
there are no missing topics associated with a location in
PESA.
PESA aims to compare locations, and its performance in
location comparison is high. However, it has a critical problem when being applied to localized article recommendation.
PESA computes the topic prior distribution to reﬂect the dependency among topics. This prior distribution forces the locations in the same geographical category to be similar locations. It is global in that it comes from the dependency relations of all possible topics. Nevertheless, the topics relevant
only to a speciﬁc location are more inﬂuential than those observed at almost all locations in the localized recommendation. For instance, assume two baseball stadiums, Rangers
Ballpark and Angel Stadium. They share many topics regarding baseball games. Hence, PESA considers them to be
similar locations. However, they should be treated diﬀerently in localized article recommendation because they are
physically far and can have diﬀerent geographically-aﬀected
topics. That is, Rangers Ballpark could have topics about
Texas, whereas Angel Stadium could have topics about Los
Angeles or California.

Figure 1: Overall process of the localized article recommendation.

Figure 1 depicts the overall process of measuring how appropriate a news article a is to a speciﬁc location l by Explicit Localized Semantic Analysis (ELSA). When l, the location of a user is given, Dl , a set of documents for l, is
crawled from geo-tagged documents such as Twitter, Facebook, and Flickr tags. Each document d in Dl is represented
as a topic vector of which dimension is the number of concepts in Wikipedia as done in ESA. Then, the location l is
represented as a product of all d’s in Dl . The concepts with
non-zero values in this product vector are the possible topics
for l, even though some non-relevant topic are also included
at this step.
We assume that the topic would be dependent on one another if they are actually related to l. In order to reﬂect this
dependency into the recommendation, a dependency graph
of the topics is constructed using the link information in
Wikipedia, and the local topic distribution is estimated from
this graph using PageRank [16]. This local topic distribution
explains which topics are actually important with respect to
l when the topics are related to each other. Therefore, it is
used as a weight vector for the product vector of Dl . Then,
the ﬁnal mapping Φ(l) of a location l into the Wikipedia
topic space is the multiplication of the product vector and
the local topic distribution.
News articles are also projected onto the Wikipedia topic
space in the same way. A news article a is ﬁrst expressed as
a topic vector as ESA does. Then, the ﬁnal mapping Φ(a)
of a is a multiplication of the topic vector of a and the local
topic distribution. Note that even the same article would
be represented diﬀerently according to the location, because
every diﬀerent location has a diﬀerent local topic distribu-

Assume that a user is speciﬁed only by his/her location
l = {longitude, latitude} ∈ R2 . The localized news article recommendation then ranks a set of articles, A =
{a1 , a2 , . . . , an } so that the order between ranks a1  a2 
. . .  an satisﬁes the geographical preference of the user at
l. The preference relation is determined by a score function
f (a, l) that always meets f (ai , l) > f (aj , l) if ai  aj . That
is, the top k (k ≤ n) articles from A scored by this function
are suggested as appropriate news articles according to the
location l.
The score function f (a, l) measures the appropriateness of
each a to l. If both a and l are represented as vectors in the
same topic space, it can be replaced by a similarity function
[3]. That is, the score function f (a, l) can be deﬁned as

Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) [7] is a topical representation of unrestricted natural language documents. When a
set of geo-tagged documents Dl for a location l is given, it
maps, for the representation of l, Dl onto a topic space which
is explicitly deﬁned with Wikipedia concepts. The dimensionality of the topic space is equivalent to the number of
Wikipedia concepts. Let T be a set of Wikipedia concepts.
Then, Dl is expressed as a topic vector

Therefore, p(d|ti , θti ) and p(ti |l, θl ) should be estimated for
each topic ti .
When we assume all words are independent, log p(d|ti , θti )
can be expressed as

log p(d|ti , θti ) =
log p(w|ti , θti ).
w∈d

Because Wikipedia concepts are adopted as topics, each
topic has its own Wikipedia article. p(w|ti , θti ) then measures how w is possibly generated from ci , which is the
Wikipedia article for ti . Thus, after add-one smoothing,
p(w|ti , θti ) is

Dl = φ1 (Dl ), φ2 (Dl ), . . . , φ|T | (Dl ).
Here, φi (Dl ) is the weight of the i-th topic for Dl and is
given as
 
φi (Dl ) =
tf idf (w, d, Dl ) · tf idf (w, ci , T )),
(2)

p(w|ti , θti ) =

d∈Dl w∈d

where ci is an article of a Wikipedia concept ti ∈ T , and
tf idf (w, d, Dl ) = tf (w, d) · idf (w, Dl ). Here, tf (w, d) is the
term frequency of w in d and idf (w, Dl ) is the inverse document frequency of w in Dl . That is, the location is represented as a topic vector through the geo-tagged documents
related to the location.
Because news articles, themselves are documents, they can
also be represented as topic vectors by ESA. Thus, ESA provides an identical semantic representation for both locations
and articles. In addition, this is a ﬁne-grained representation of locations and articles due to the rich world-knowledge
of Wikipedia. However, some topics that are irrelevant to
l can be included in Dl . Since ESA does not consider any
geographical context of a location, it is aﬀected by those
irrelevant topics.
ELSA is diﬀerent from ESA in that it considers the geographical context of a location in expressing the locations
and articles. ELSA reinforces ESA with a local topic distribution. Figure 2 shows the graphical representation of
ELSA. Here, a document d ∈ Dl depends on topics t ∈ T ,
and the topics are dependent on a location l. Note that l
and d are the observed variables, while t is the unobserved
one. θl denotes the local topic distribution at l and θt is the
word distribution of the topic t. Both are also unobserved
variables.

4.2 Estimating Local Topic Distribution
The local topic distribution p(ti |l, θl ) denotes the probability of a topic ti at the location l. However, most topics
at l are often coherent so that they are dependent on one
another. This dependency among topics makes it diﬃcult
to estimate p(ti |l, θl ) directly. Thus, ELSA ﬁrst constructs
the dependency structure of local topics of l, and then approximates p(ti |l, θl ) with it.
As a ﬁrst step to derive p(ti |l, θl ), all topics related to l
should be identiﬁed. Because p(Dl |ti , θti ) is the probability
that topic ti generates geo-tagged documents Dl of l, the
actual topics of l are those with non-zero p(Dl |ti , θti ). We
denote the set of these actual topics as Tl . Then, the dependency structure of the topics of Tl is constructed using
the link information within Wikipedia articles. Wikipedia
articles often contain hyperlinks to other articles. These hyperlinks have semantics because all Wikipedia articles are
published and managed carefully and manually by massive
users, According to Kamps and Kollen [10], the hyperlinks
in Wikipedia articles reﬂect semantic relationships among
Wikipedia concepts. Because ELSA uses Wikipedia concepts as its geographical topics, it is natural to use these link

information among topics in Tl for the dependency structure
of the topics. ELSA represents the dependency structure as
a directed graph. For instance, when Central park has a
hyperlink to National historic landmark, the corresponding
dependency exists from Central park to National historic
landmark.
When the dependency structure of Tl is given, ELSA approximates p(ti |l, θl ) from it according to the PageRank algorithm [16], because the values obtained from PageRank
can be regarded as probabilities of the graph nodes in a
complicated link structure [8]. That is, p(ti |l, θl ) is

4.4 Comparison with PESA
The probabilistic ESA (PESA) is another topical representation of documents based on ESA [21], and is designed
to compare locations through geo-tagged documents. It assigns high similarity to the pairs of locations in the same
geographical category, while assigning very low similarities
to the pairs of locations from diﬀerent categories. For this,
it regards, as geographical topics, the Wikipedia concepts
of which a Wikipedia article has geo-tags or hyperlinks to
other geo-tagged Wikipedia articles. Then, PESA uses these
geographical topics to estimate a topic distribution.
PESA also estimates a topic distribution to reﬂect dependencies among topics. Because it considers the dependency
of almost all topics, the global topics shared by most locations in a geographical category have high probabilities
in the topic distribution of PESA. These global topics are
important in PESA, since PESA focuses on location comparison in which similar locations share geographical topics. On the other hand, the task of a localized news article
recommendation aims to oﬀer appropriate articles for each
speciﬁc location. That is, the local characteristics are more
important in this task than the global characteristics. Many

4.3 Article Representation
ELSA projects a location onto the topic space of Wikipedia
concepts through a set of geo-tagged documents. Therefore,
when a set of news articles, A = {a1 , a2 , . . . , an } is given, all
articles of A can be projected onto the topic space because
news articles are also documents. Thus, the projection of an
article a ∈ A can be written as


Φ(a) = p(a, t1 , l|θl , θt1 ), . . . , p(a, t|T | , l|θl , θt|T | ) .
Since we assume that the location probability p(l) is uniform,

where na (w) denotes the frequency of a word w in a. The
term p(ti |l, θl ) is the local topic distribution given in Equation (5). Because this term depends on l, it becomes diﬀerent for every diﬀerent l. As a result, even the same news
article is represented diﬀerently if the location changes.

egories: ‘Airport’, ‘Baseball stadium’, and ‘National park’.
The keywords of the Flickr images are used as a set of geotagged documents, Dl for location l. These are adopted as
geo-tagged documents because the keywords are often a description of the location. For each location, l in Table 1, the
images that are closely associated with l are crawled through
Flickr API (http://www.flickr.com/services/api). The
GPS information attached to the images is used to determine their association with l. We determined that the image
would be associated with l if the distance from l to the image location is within a predeﬁned threshold. The threshold
used was 0.2 km for ‘Baseball stadium’, 1 km for ‘Airport’,
and 10 km for ‘National park’. The keywords tagged to an
image are regarded as a geo-tagged document.
Table 2 describes the Flickr data set used in the experiments. The locations in the category of ‘Airport’ have 177.8
documents on average, whereas those in ‘Baseball stadium’
and ‘National park’ have 179 and 201 documents, respectively. The average number of keywords in a document is
7.49 in ‘Airport’, 8.66 in ‘Baseball stadium’, and 6.74 in
‘National park’. The last attribute is the number of unique
keywords. ‘Airport’ has 1,895 unique keywords, and ‘Baseball stadium’ and ‘National park’ have 900 and 1,010 unique
keywords respectively.
A Wikipedia snapshot as of May 2, 2012 was used to generate geographical topics. A preprocessing described in [21]
was adapted to the snapshot to exclude irrelevant topics,
such as digit, time, and so on. After preprocessing, 1,116,275
concepts remain, and they are used for a topic set T in all
the experiments below. The number of unique terms in this
Wikipedia snapshot was 1,498,045.
The New York Times (NYT) corpus was adopted as a
pool of news articles. This corpus contained 1,841,402 articles published by the New York Times from 1987 to 2007.
Among them, the articles from January 1, 2006 to June 19,
2007 were actually used as a set of news articles, A. This
set contained 127,005 articles composed of 356,595 distinct
words.
ELSA was compared using four baseline methods: BOW,
LDA, ESA, and PESA. BOW is the bag-of-words model that
represents locations and articles with the frequency of words.
Thus, the need for a topic model in a localized article recommendation can be shown by a comparison with BOW. Three
topic-based models, LDA, ESA, and PESA were prepared
to evaluate the eﬀectiveness of ELSA. LDA is the Latent
Dirichlet Allocation that is used widely in the various applications to extract topics from documents. ESA and PESA
both use Wikipedia concepts as their topics, but PESA additionally models the prior distribution of geographical topics.
The performance of these methods were compared with
two metrics: (i) Rt10 (Rating of Top 10), the average score
of recommended articles, and (ii) Normalized Discounted
Cumulative Gain at top k (NDCG@k) which is widely used

topics that are important globally are often not important
locally. Therefore, PESA is unsuitable for this task.
ELSA estimates the distribution of only local topics. In
the topic distribution of ELSA, the topics directly associated
with a given location have high probabilities. As a result,
even the locations from the same category have diﬀerent
topic distributions. This is reasonable because the locations
could have diﬀerent geographical context even if they belong
to the same category.
The advantage of ELSA can be addressed by a simple example. Figure 3 shows the topic structures of two locations:
Angel Stadium at Anaheim, CA (Figure 3(a)) and Rangers
Ballpark at Arlington, TX (Figure 3(b)). In these graphs,
the nodes are topics and the edges are their dependencies.
The top thirteen topics were chosen from each location according to the probabilities over its Dl .
ELSA assigns high probabilities to the black nodes in each
graph, because the nodes are local hubs. When the location
is Angel Stadium, “Los Angeles, Angels of Anaheim” and
“Angel Stadium of Anaheim” have high probabilities. On
the other hand, the highest probability is assigned to the
topic of “Texas Rangers” in the topic distribution of Rangers
Ballpark. As a result, even the same article would be represented diﬀerently due to these diﬀerent local topics.
PESA uses the dependency structure of all topics. Thus,
it determines the topic distribution from the combined graph
in Figure 3(c). After the graphs of Figure 3(a) and 3(b) are
combined, the topics such as “Major League Baseball” and
“Baseball World Cup” (gray nodes in this graph) are considered as hubs. These topics shared by two locations force
the topic vectors of the locations to be similar. Therefore,
PESA is eﬀective in location comparison. However, the emphasis on global topics is adverse to localized news article
recommendation in which local topics are preferable.

EXPERIMENTS

5.1 Experimental Settings
For the evaluation of ELSA, ﬁfteen locations in USA are
selected manually. Table 1 lists the locations and their categories. All locations belong to one of three geographical cat-

298

BOW showed the second best performance with 1.69 of
Rt10. This is an unexpected result, because BOW does not
adopt topics to represent articles and locations. The good
performance of BOW originates mostly from the locations
of ‘Baseball stadium’. Most geo-tagged documents for baseball stadiums contain the name of home teams, which allows a simple lexical matching to work well. As a result, the
Rt10 score of BOW for ‘Baseball stadium’ was very high.
However, its performance in other categories was lower than
ESA-based topic models. Therefore, from the results of LDA
and BOW the topical representation leads to high performance in localized article recommendation, if the topic space
is rich enough to cover the entire topics.
ELSA was found to be the best method in this experiment. ELSA achieved signiﬁcantly higher performance than
the other methods. Its Rt10 in ‘Airport’ and ‘Baseball stadium’ was much higher than those of others. In ‘National
park’, ESA showed the best Rt10 of 1.620, but the diﬀerence between ELSA and ESA was only 0.06. As a result,
ELSA outperformed all other methods with an overall Rt10
of 2.026, and was the only method of which the overall Rt10
was more than 2.0. The outperformance of ELSA over other
methods was statistically signiﬁcant with a conﬁdence interval of 95%. The p-values of the T-test against the null
hypothesis that ELSA does not outperform other methods
were all below 0.05. The essential factor of ELSA that distinguishes it from ESA and PESA is the use of the local
topic distribution as the geographical context of a location,
Therefore, the best performance of ELSA proves the importance of a geographical context of locations in location and
article representation.
The overall quality of the recommended articles can be
veriﬁed by Rt10. However, the quality of a method can
be poor, even if the method achieves a high Rt10. This
occurs when a large number of recommended news articles
receive 1 or 2 point by human evaluators. Therefore, it is
important to determine how many articles receive 2 or 3
point. Figure 4 shows the number of recommended articles
for each score. As shown in this ﬁgure, the quality of ELSA is
best in that most of the articles recommended by it received
2 or 3 point. In particular, an examination of the overall
category (Figure 4-(d)) showed that, the number of articles
with 3 point recommended by ELSA exceeded those by other
methods. Note that most articles recommended by PESA
received 2 point. This is because PESA uses the distribution
of all topics, which makes it diﬃcult for the locations within
the same category to be distinguished. On the other hand,
even though ELSA shares topics with PESA, it eﬀectively
characterizes the geographical context of each location by
its local topic distribution. As a result, ELSA recommends
the articles that match the given location better than the
other methods.
The Rt10 scores and number of articles with high scores
have a tendency to decrease, as the location boundary becomes larger. The Rt10 score for ‘National park’ that has a
boundary of 10 km was the worst, whereas that for ‘Baseball stadium’ with a boundary of 0.2 km was the best. This
is because a location has a range of geographical topics as
its boundary becomes large, and this variety of topics decreases the locality eﬀect of the topics. However, ELSA
outperformed the other methods regardless of how large the
location boundary was.

for measuring the rank accuracy. Two human evaluators are
employed to label the scores of news articles manually. Since
there are too many articles in the data set, the evaluation
was done only for the recommended articles. That is, for a
given location, all ﬁve methods including ELSA select their
own top ten articles. Accordingly, the number of news articles per location is at most 50. Since two or more methods
can recommend the same articles, the evaluators score normally less than 50 articles per each location. The guidelines
of scoring news articles are as follows.
• 0 point: The article has nothing to with the geographical category.
• 1 point: The article is weakly related to the geographical category.
• 2 point: The article belongs to the geographical category, but is not related to the location.
• 3 point: The article is strongly related to the location.
Table 3 lists the Kappa values of the scores by the evaluators. As shown in this table, Kappa values for ‘Baseball
stadium’ and ‘National park’ were approximately 0.68, and
approximately 30 distinct articles are recommended for each
location. These values corresponded to substantial agreement. For ‘Airport’, the Kappa value was 0.51, which falls
in moderate agreement, and the average distinct articles per
location was 32.8.

5.2 Experimental Results
Table 4 shows the Rt10 values of the ﬁve methods. As
shown in this table, LDA achieved 1.420, which was the
worst performance. This Rt10 was obtained when LDA
shows the best performance with 500 topics. The fact that
LDA was worst among the ﬁve methods implies that it fails
to capture diverse topics of news articles and locations. On
the other hand, all methods based on Wikipedia concepts
outperform LDA. This result highlights the eﬀectiveness of
the Wikipedia concepts as geographical topics.

methods proves the importance of geographical topics in the
localized news article recommendation. Interestingly, ELSA
and ESA showed a similar tendency in NDCG@k for all categories as k increased even though NDCG@k of ELSA was
always higher than that of ESA. This fact implies that ELSA
improves ESA successfully and substantially as its expansion
for localized news article recommendation by adopting the
local topic distribution.

The ranking performance of the methods was also measured with NDCG@k. Figure 5 shows the NDCG@k values
with k from 1 to 10. Even with this metric, ELSA outperformed the others for all geographical categories. Although PESA achieved a similar performance in ‘Baseball
stadium’, its performance was lower than ESA and BOW in
‘National park’. BOW showed the lowest NDCG@k when k
was less than 3. Because it considers only the shared words
by the news articles and geo-tagged documents, it recommends many irrelevant articles with some general words. For
instance, many articles with a word, angel are irrelevant to
Angel Stadium, and those with bush are irrelevant to George
Bush Airport.
ELSA outperformed the others consistently for all k’s. All
improvements in NDCG@k of ELSA over the other methods
are also statistically signiﬁcant, because the p-values against
the null hypothesis were less than 0.05. In particular, when
k ≤ 3, a large gap between ELSA and other methods was
observed. As k was increased up to 10, this gap became
smaller but was still higher than others. This result suggests
that ELSA recommends news articles successfully that are
appropriate to the geographical context.
PESA was the second best and also reﬂected the distribution of geographical topics in representing articles with
topics. Thus, the superiority of ELSA and PESA over other

6. CONCLUSION
This paper proposed a localized news article recommendation with the Explicit Localized Semantic Analysis (ELSA).
The location of a user provides valuable information as user
context, because each location has its own geographical topics, which are often strongly related to the user context at
that location. Therefore, the proposed method recommends
the news articles that are appropriate to the location by reﬂecting the geographical context of user. For this, ELSA
represents news articles as the topic vectors of Wikipedia
concepts. The weight of each topic for an article is adjusted
to reﬂect the geographical context of the user. The user
location is also expressed as a topic vector through the geotagged documents of the user location. Because the concerns of the user are aﬀected by his/her location, even the
same article should be represented diﬀerently according to

focused on their physical attributes. In this paper, by considering topics of a location as its geographical context, the
articles that match the geographical context of a location
could be recommended. Second, we manually constructed a
data set for localized article recommendation. 459 news articles out of approximately 120,000 articles of the New York
Times were tagged with scores from 0 to 3 with respect to
their relevance to ﬁfteen locations. Because this is the ﬁrst
data set for localized article recommendation, it can be used
for further developments.

the user’s location. To reﬂect it into article recommendation,
ELSA models the dependencies of local topics. Then, the local topic distribution estimated from the topic dependencies
is applied to represent both locations and news articles.
ELSA was evaluated with the New York Times corpus
for ﬁfteen famous locations. It was compared with four
other methods: BOW, LDA, ESA, and PESA. All the methods were evaluated with two kinds of metrics: Rt10 and
NDCG@k. According to the experimental results, ELSA
outperformed all other methods substantially. The superiority of ELSA over BOW and LDA implies the eﬀectiveness
of the topic space by the Wikipedia concepts. PESA, another ESA-based topic model achieved higher performance
than other methods including ESA, itself. Although both
ELSA and PESA adopt the topic space by Wikipedia concepts, they are diﬀerent in that ELSA uses a local topic
distribution whereas PESA uses a global topic distribution.
The performance of ELSA was superior to that of PESA in
both metrics, because the local topic distribution is more
appropriate than the global topic distribution in localized
article recommendation.
The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, this
is the ﬁrst eﬀort to recommend articles according to user
locations. Although every location has its own geographical topics, most legacy localized recommendation systems
