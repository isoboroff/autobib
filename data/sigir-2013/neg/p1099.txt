ABSTRACT

most popular pages in a hierarchical tree, going from general
to particular categories.
Wikipedia is ranked by Alexa in the sixth position globally. Due to the large amount of information and the wide
number of subjects contained in Wikipedia, it is quite difficult to develop an automatic system to categorize all its
contents into a standardized tree, such as those employed in
web directories. As in ODP, currently this task is carried
out manually by a large group of volunteers.
Our proposal tries to automatically identify medical Wikipedia articles in order to provide an interface to access this
resource by categories as in a web directory. With this purpose, we employ machine learning techniques to train and
filter relevant information on particular domains.

Wikipedia has become one of the most important sources of
information available all over the world. However, the categorization of Wikipedia articles is not standardized and the
searches are mainly performed on keywords rather than concepts. In this paper we present an application that builds
a hierarchical structure to organize all Wikipedia entries, so
that medical articles can be reached from general to particular, using the well known Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)
thesaurus. Moreover, the language links between articles
will allow using the directory created in different languages.
The final system can be packed and ported to mobile devices
as a standalone offline application.

2. CLASSIFYING WIKIPEDIA ARTICLES
INTO MEDICAL CATEGORIES
Our classification system takes Wikipedia articles as an
input and decides whether they are inside medical scope or
not, and in case they are, try to find one or several categories where they could fit. To achieve this goal, we need
a corpus containing a large amount of training data and a
categorization algorithm.
For the first requirement, MEDLINE3 provides us with
millions of free documents covering thousands of medical
subjects. The thesaurus employed to hierarchically categorize every bibliographic entry in this database is known as
MeSH.4 Thus, we have a large corpus consisting on more
than 2 million documents associated to more than 25,000
topics in the MeSH thesaurus. Due to the popularity and
free availability of these resources, a fully functional interface is currently available to get all training data by means
of simple queries, such as “Diseases category[majr]” which
retrieves all articles related to any disease (the expansion is
done automatically by the system [3]). All these considerations have been taken into account to choose this corpus,
since it may lead us to enhance the results and simplify the
maintenance and future upgrades of our application.
Regarding the second requirement, we must consider the
size of the data we are working with. Our proposal employs
our own classification algorithm, namely NEWPAR [5], designed to work with large corpora. This algorithm has been

INTRODUCTION

Some web directories have gained popularity in the last
years. It is the case of the Open Directory Project (ODP),1
manually maintained by a large community of editors. Nowadays this directory stores more than five million sites, which
are classified on more than one million categories organized
hierarchically. This thesaurus is employed by other companies such as Alexa.2 This webpage allows users to get the

the need for Internet connection. The interface on the client
side has been developed using jQuery Mobile [4], a library
which allows to write HTML and Javascript source code
that can be interpreted by almost any device containing a
simple browser. This ensures the possibility to use the application in most devices (both mobile and non-mobile platforms) and also in any of the existing operating systems.
We also provide the users with the native code [2] by using
the PhoneGap [1] framework, as it allows to create mobile
apps using standardized web APIs. The final result is an
application that can run on any kind of computers through
a website (http://www.lookforwiki.com) and that can also
be compiled and installed to get it working natively with a
single codebase on systems such as Android, iOS, Windows,
Blackberry, webOS and Symbian.

MULTILINGUAL SCENARIO

The classification algorithm mentioned above will only
handle documents written in English to complete both the
training phase with the MEDLINE documents and the subsequent offline classification of Wikipedia articles. This process is transparent to the final user, since it is done through
a batch process. To achieve this goal, each entry in the XML
file containing all the summaries of Wikipedia articles5 has
been transformed into plain text and classified in order to
provide a ranked list of links for each particular topic.
Both Wikipedia articles and MeSH vocabulary are available in different languages, and links between English versions and other languages are provided in both resources,
making it possible to develop a multilingual application. Although the documents are originally classified in English, if
the user chooses another language the system only has to
find the correspondences in either the MeSH entries or the
pages in Wikipedia.
As it is shown in Figure 1 (left), the user selects a language and automatically gets a list of topics followed by the
number of Wikipedia related articles. More particular topics can be accessed navigating down the MeSH tree. The
user can finally get the links to each article by clicking on
category name.
In order to enrich the information provided to the user,
our application extracts (this is done also in an offline phase)
a brief description of the suggested links to Wikipedia pages,
extracted from the XML dump files of each language as
shown in Figure 1 (right). Finally the whole contents can
be accessed through the ranked links as shown in Figure 2.
