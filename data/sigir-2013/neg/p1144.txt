ABSTRACT

ping structures. Hence, my research on overlapping structures comprises three main parts: (1) an indexing method
that supports both hierarchies and overlaps; (2) a query processing method based on the indexing technique and (3) a
query language that is close to natural language and supports both full text and structural queries.
Our approach for indexing overlaps is to adapt the PrePost [3] XML indexing method to overlapping structures.
This method labels each node with its start and end positions and requires modest storage space. However, PrePost
indexing cannot be used for overlapping nodes. To overcome
this issue, we need to define a data model for overlapping
structures. Since hierarchies are not sufficient to describe
overlapping components, several data structures have been
introduced by scholars. One of the most interesting data
models is GODDAG [2]. GODDAG is a tree-like graph,
where nodes can have multiple parentage. This model can
support overlaps as well as simple inheritance. Our proposed data model for indexing overlaps is such a tree-like
structure, where we can define overlapping, parent-child and
ancestor-descendant relationships.

Structural information retrieval is mostly based on hierarchy. However, in real life information is not purely hierarchical and structural elements may overlap each other.
The most common example is a document with two distinct
structural views, where the logical view is section/ subsection/ paragraph and the physical view is page/ line.
Each single structural view of this document is a hierarchy
and the components are either disjoint or nested inside each
other. The overlapping issue arises when one structural element cannot be neatly nested into others. For instance,
when a paragraph starts in one page and terminates in the
next page. Similar situations can appear in videos and other
multimedia contents, where temporal or spatial constituents
of a media file may overlap each other.
Querying over overlapping structures is one of the challenges of large scale search engines. For instance, FSIS
(FAST Search for Internet Sites) [1] is a Microsoft search
platform, which encounters overlaps while analysing content of textual data. FSIS uses a pipeline process to extract
structure and semantic information of documents. The pipeline contains several components, where each component
writes annotations to the input data. These annotations
consist of structural elements and some of them may overlap each other. Handling overlapping structures in search
engines will add a novel capability of searching, where users
can ask queries such as “Find all the words that overlap two
lines” or “Find the music played during Intro scene of Avatar
movie”. There are also other use cases, where the user of the
search engine is not a person, but is a specific program with
complex, non-traditional information retrieval needs.
This research attempts to index overlapping structures
and provide efficient query processing for large-scale search
engines. The current research on overlapping structures revolves around encoding and modelling data, while indexing
and query processing methods need investigations. Moreover, due to intrinsic complexity of overlaps, XML indexing
and query processing techniques cannot be used for overlap-
