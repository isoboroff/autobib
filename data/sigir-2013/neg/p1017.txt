ABSTRACT

(u1, u5))

Random Walk with Restart (RWR) has become an appealing measure of node proximities in emerging applications
e.g., recommender systems and automatic image captioning.
In practice, a real graph is typically large, and is frequently
updated with small changes. It is often cost-inhibitive to recompute proximities from scratch via batch algorithms when
the graph is updated. This paper focuses on the incremental
computations of RWR in a dynamic graph, whose edges
often change over time. The prior attempt of RWR [1]
deploys k-dash to ﬁnd top-k highest proximity nodes for
a given query, which involves a strategy to incrementally
estimate upper proximity bounds. However, due to its aim
to prune needless calculation, such an incremental strategy
is approximate: in O(1) time for each node. The main
contribution of this paper is to devise an exact and fast
incremental algorithm of RWR for edge updates. Our solution, IRWR , can incrementally compute any node proximity
in O(1) time for each edge update without loss of exactness. The empirical evaluations show the high eﬃciency and
exactness of IRWR for computing proximities on dynamic
networks against its batch counterparts.

Figure 1: Computing RWR Incrementally
a query node. In RWR, the proximity of node u w.r.t. query
node q is deﬁned as the limiting probability that a random
surfer, starting from q, and then iteratively either moving
to one of its out-neighbors with probability weighted by the
edge weights, or restarting from q with probability c, will
eventually arrive at node u. Recently, RWR has received
increasing attention (e.g., for collaborative ﬁltering [1] and
image labeling [5]) since it can fairly capture the global
structure of graphs, and relations in interlinked networks [6].
Prior RWR computing methods are based on static graphs,
which is costly: Given a graph G(V, E), and a query q ∈ V ,
k-dash [1] yields, in the worse case, O(|V |2 ) time and space,
which, in practice, can be bounded by O(|E| + |V |), to ﬁnd
top-k highest proximity nodes. B LIN and NB LIN [4] need
O(|V |2 ) time and space for computing all node proximities.
In general, real graphs are often constantly updated with
small changes. This calls for the need for incremental algorithms to compute proximities. We state the problem below:
Problem (Incremental Update for RWR)
Given a graph G, proximities P for G, changes ΔG to G,
a query node q, and a restarting probability c ∈ (0, 1).
Compute changes to the proximities w.r.t. q exactly.
Here, P is a proximity matrix whose entry [P]i,j denotes the
proximity of node i w.r.t. query j, and ΔG is comprised of
a set of edges to be inserted into or deleted from G.
In contrast with the existing batch algorithms [1, 4] that
recompute the updated proximities from scratch, our incremental algorithm can exploit the dynamic nature of graphs
by pre-computing proximities only once on the entire graph
via a batch algorithm, and then incrementally computing
their changes in response to updates. The response time of
RWR can be greatly improved by maximal use of previous
computation, as shown in Example 1.
Example 1. Figure 1 depicts a graph G, taken from [1].
Given the query u2 , the old proximities P for G, and c =
0.2, we want to compute new proximities w.r.t. u2 when
there is an edge (u1 , u5 ) inserted into G, denoted by ΔG.
The existing methods, k-dash and B LIN, have to recompute
the new proximities in G ∪ ΔG from scratch, without using
the previously computed proximities in G, which is costly.

1. INTRODUCTION
Measuring node proximities in graphs is a key task of web
search. Due to various applications in recommender systems
and social networks, many proximity metrics have come into
play. For instance, Brin and Page [2] invented PageRank
to determine the ranking of web pages. Jeh and Widom
[3] proposed SimRank to assess node-to-node proximities.
Random Walk with Restart (RWR) [4] is one of such useful
proximity metrics for ranking nodes in order of relevance to

However, we observe that the increment [ΔP],u2 1 to the old
[P],u2 is the linear combination of [P],u1 and [P],u5 ,i.e.,
[ΔP],u2 = α · [P],u1 + β · [P],u5 + λ · e5

with α = 0.25, β = −0.32, λ = 0.06. Hence, there are opportunities to incrementally compute the changes [ΔP],u2
by fully utilizing the old proximities of P. As opposed to
k-dash and B LIN involving matrix-vector multiplications,
computing [ΔP],u2 via Eq.(1) only needs vector scaling and
additions, thus greatly improving the response time.

[P],q = (1 − c) · A · [P],q + c · eq

As suggested by Example 1, when the graph G is updated,
it is imperative to incrementally compute new proximities by
leveraging information from the old proximities. However, it
is a grand challenge to characterize the changes [ΔP],q in
terms of a linear combination of the columns in old P, since
it seems hard to determine the scalars α, β, λ for Eq.(1).
Worse still, much less is known about how to extract a subset
of columns from the old P (e.g., why [P],u1 and [P],u5 are
chosen from P in Eq.(1)), to express the changes [ΔP],q .
Contributions. This paper aims to tackle these problems.
To the best of our knowledge, this work makes the ﬁrst eﬀort
to study incremental RWR computing in evolving graphs,
with no loss of exactness. 1) We ﬁrst consider unit update,
i.e., a single-edge insertion or deletion, and derive an elegant
formula that characterizes the proximity changes as a linear
combination of the columns from the old proximity matrix.
2) We then devise an incremental algorithm for batch update,
i.e., a list of edge deletions and insertions mixed together,
and show that any node proximity can be computed in O(1)
time for every edge update, with no sacriﬁce in accuracy.
3) Our empirical study demonstrates that the incremental
approach greatly outperforms k-dash [1], a batch algorithm
that is reported as the best for RWR proximity computing,
when networks are constantly updated.
Organization. Section 2 overviews the background of RWR.
The incremental RWR is studied in Section 3. Section 4
gives empirical results, followed by open issues in Section 5.
Related Work. Incremental algorithms have proved useful
in various node proximity computations on evolving graphs,
such as the personalized PageRank [7] and SimRank [8].
However, very few results are known on incremental RWR
computing, far less than their batch counterparts [1, 4, 9].
k-dash [1] is the best known approach to ﬁnding top-k highest RWR proximity nodes for a given query, which involves a
strategy to incrementally estimate upper proximity bounds.
Nevertheless, such an incremental strategy is approximate:
in O(1) time for each node, which is mainly developed for
pruning unnecessary computation. In contrast, our incremental algorithm can, without loss of exactness, compute
any node proximity in O(1) time for every edge update.
Moore et al. [10] leveraged a sampling approach with branch
and bound pruning to ﬁnd near neighbors of a query w.h.p..
However, their incremental algorithm is probabilistic. Later,
Zhou et al. [9] generalized the original RWR by incorporating node attributes into link structure for graph clustering.
Based on this, an incremental version of [9] was proposed by
Cheng et al. [11], with the focus to support attribute update.
It diﬀers from this work in that our incremental algorithm is
designed for structure update. Thus, [11] cannot cope with
hyperlink changes incrementally in dynamic graphs.

PRELIMINARIES

We formally overview the background of this paper. Graphs
studies here are directed graphs with no multiple edges.
RWR Formula [1]. In a graph G(V, E), let A be the transition matrix (i.e., column normalized adjacency matrix) of
G, whose entry [A]u,v = d1v if (u, v) ∈ E, and 0 otherwise.
Here, dv denotes the in-degree of v. Given query node q ∈ V ,
and restart probability c ∈ (0, 1), the proximity of node u
w.r.t. q, denoted by [P]u,q , is recursively deﬁned as follows:

[X],j denotes the j-th column vector of matrix X.
ei is the |V | × 1 unit vector with a 1 in the i-th entry.

1018

(2)

where [P],q is the |V | × 1 proximity vector w.r.t. q (i.e., the
q-th column of matrix P), whose u-th entry equals to [P]u,q .
eq is the |V | × 1 unit query vector, whose q-th entry is 1.
Intuitively, [P]u,q is the limiting probability, denoting the
long-term visit rate of node u, given a bias toward query q.
The RWR proximity deﬁned in Eq.(2) can be rewritten as
[P],q = c(I − (1 − c) · A)−1 · eq

(3)

where I is the |V | × |V | identity matrix.
Existing methods of computing RWR are in a batch style,
with the aim to accelerate the matrix inversion in Eq.(3).
For instance, k-dash [1] uses LU decomposition and an incremental pruning strategy to speed up the matrix inversion.

INCREMENTAL RWR COMPUTING

We now study the incremental RWR computation. Given
the old P for G, changes ΔG to G, query q, and c ∈ (0, 1),
the goal is to compute [ΔP],q for ΔG. The key idea of our
approach is to maximally reuse the previous computation,
by characterizing [ΔP],q as a linear combination of the
columns from the old P. The main result is as follows.
Theorem 1. Any node proximity of a given query can be
incrementally computed in O(1) time for each edge update.
To prove Theorem 1, we ﬁrst consider unit edge update,
and then devise an incremental algorithm for batch updates,
with the desired complexity bound.
Unit Update. The update (insertion/deletion) of an edge
from G may lead to the changes [ΔP],q of the proximity.
We incrementally compute [ΔP],q based on the following.
Proposition 1. Given a query q, and the old proximity
matrix P for G, if there is an edge insertion (i, j) into G,
then the changes [ΔP],q w.r.t. q can be computed as

(dj > 0)

where dj is the in-degree of node j in the old G, and [y]j is
the j-th entry of vector y.
If there is an edge deletion (i, j) from G, then [ΔP],q can
also be computed via Eq.(4) with y being replaced by

As opposed to the traditional methods, e.g., k-dash and
B LIN, that requires matrix-vector multiplications to compute new proximities via Eq.(2), Proposition 1 allows merely
vector scaling and additions for eﬃciently computing [ΔP],q .
The proof of Proposition 1 is attained by combining the
three following lemmas.

Lemma 1. Let A be the old transition matrix of G. If
there is an edge insertion (i, j) into G, then the new transition matrix Ã is updated by

Ã = A + aeT

Proof. Due to space limits, we shall merely prove the
insertion case. A similar proof holds for the deletion case.
(i) When dj = 0, [A],j = 0. Thus, for an inserted edge
(i, j), [A]i,j will be updated from 0 to 1, i.e., Ã = A + ei eTj .
(ii) When dj > 0, all the nonzero entries of [A],j are d1j .
Thus, for an inserted edge (i, j), we ﬁrst update [A]i,j from
0 to d1j , i.e., A ⇒ A + d1j ei eTj , and then change all nonzero
entries of [A +

Substituting this back produces the ﬁnal results.
Combining Lemmas 1–3 together proves Proposition 1.
Algorithm for Batch Updates. Based on Proposition 1,
we devise IRWR, an incremental RWR algorithm to handle
a set ΔG of edge insertions and deletions (batch update).
IRWR is shown in Algorithm 1. Given the old P for G
w.r.t. query q, and the batch edge updates ΔG, it computes
new proximities w.r.t. q in G∪ΔG without loss of exactness.
It works as follows. For each edge (i, j) to be updated, it ﬁrst
computes the auxiliary vector y from a linear combination
of only a few columns in P (lines 2–10). Using y, it then
(i) removes (i, j) from ΔG (line 11) and (ii) updates the
proximities w.r.t. each remaining node in ΔG (lines 12–14).
After all the edges are eliminated from ΔG, IRWR ﬁnally
calculates the new proximities [P̃],q from y (line 15).

Lemma 3. Suppose there is an edge update (i, j) to G,

Proof. Due to space limits, we shall only prove the edge
insertion case. A similar proof holds for the deletion case.
(i) When dj = 0, a = ei . Then, Eq.(3) implies that

Combining (i) and (ii), Eq.(5) is derived.
Lemma 1 suggests that each edge change will incur a rankone update of A. To see how the update of A aﬀects the
changes to P, we have the following lemma.
Lemma 2. Let P be the old proximity matrix for G. If
there is an edge update (i, j) to G, then the new proximity
P̃ w.r.t. a given query q is updated as
[P̃],q = [P],q + (1 − c)γ · z

Lemma 2 tells that for each edge update, the changes to
P are just associated with the scaling operation of vector z.
However, it is costly to compute z via Eq.(7) as it involves
the inversion of a matrix. Lemma 3 provides an eﬃcient way
of computing (I − (1 − c)A)−1 a from a few columns of P.

= 0.25 × [P],u1 − 0.32 × [P],u5 + 0.06 × e5 ,
which explains why the values of α, β, λ are chosen for Eq.(1).
IRWR then removes (u1 , u5 ) from ΔG (line 11). Using
y, it updates proximities w.r.t. u4 , u6 ∈ ΔG (lines 12–14).
Thus, [P],u4 = (.17, .05, .23, .28, .23, .05, 0)T , and [P],u6 =
(.14, .04, .18, .23, .18, .24, 0)T after (u1, u5) is added to G.
Likewise, for the edge deletion (u4 , u6 ), du6 = 1 implies
1
y = − 0.2
× [P],u4 (line 8). Then, (u4 , u6 ) is removed from
ΔG (line 11). Since ΔG = ∅, the changes [ΔP],u2 for the
deleted (u4 , u6 ) is obtained (via line 15):
[ΔP],u2 = 0.8γ · y = −0.17 × [P],u4 with γ =

⇒ [P̃],u2 = [P],u2 + [ΔP],u2 = (.25, .24, .04, .04, .22, .04, 0)T .

Correctness & Complexity. To complete the proof of
Theorem 1, we notice that (i) IRWR can correctly compute RWR proximities, which is veriﬁed by Proposition 1.
Moreover, IRWR always terminates, since the size of ΔG is
monotonically decreasing. (ii) One can readily verify that
for each edge update, IRWR involves only vector scaling and
additions, which is in O(1) time for each node proximity.

4. EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION
We present an empirical study on real and synthetic data
to evaluate the eﬃciency of IRWR for incremental computation, as compared with (a) its batch counterpart B LIN [4],
(b) k-dash [1], the best known algorithm for top-k search,
and (c) IncPPR [7], the incremental personalized PageRank.
Two real datasets are adopted: (a) p2p-Gnutella, a Gnutella
P2P digraph, in which nodes represent hosts, and edges host
connections. The dataset has 62.5K nodes and 147.9K edges.
(b) cit-HepPh, a citation network from Arxiv, where nodes
denote papers, and edges paper citations. We extracted a
snapshot with 27.7K nodes and 352.8K edges.
GraphGen3 is used to build synthetic graphs and updates.
Graphs are controlled by (a) the number of nodes |V |, and
(b) the number of edges |E|; updates by (a) update type
(edge insertion or deletion), and (b) the size of updates |ΔG|.
All the algorithms are implemented in Visual C++ 10.0.
We used a machine with an Intel Core(TM) 3.10GHz CPU
and 8GB RAM, running Windows 7.
We set restarting probability c = 0.2 in our experiments.
Experimental Results. We next present our ﬁndings.
1) Incremental Eﬃciency. We ﬁrst evaluate the computational time of IRWR on both real and synthetic data.
Figures 2(a) and 2(b) depict the results for edges inserted
to p2p-Gnutella (|V |=62.5K) and cit-HepPh (|V |=27.7K), respectively. Fixing |V |, we vary |E| as shown in the x-axis.
Here, the updates are the diﬀerence of snapshots w.r.t. the
collection time of datasets, reﬂecting their real-life evolution.
We ﬁnd that (a) IRWR outperforms k-dash on p2p-Gnutella for
92.7% (resp. cit-HepPh for 97.5%) of edge updates. When
the changes are 61.9% on p2p-Gnutella (83.8% on cit-HepPh),

Example 2. Recall P and G of Figure 1. Consider batch
updates ΔG, which insert edge (u1 , u5 ) and delete (u4 , u6 ),
where (u1 , u5 ) is given in Example 1. IRWR computes the
new proximities [P],u2 w.r.t. query u2 in G+ΔG as follows:
For the edge insertion (u1 , u5 ), since du5 = 3 and c = 0.2,
y = 1.25 × [P],u1 − 1.56 × [P],u5 + 0.31 × e5 (via line 5).
Before proceeding with the edge deletion, let us look at the
changes [ΔP],u2 (via line 14) for the inserted (u1 , u5 ):

Figure 2: Performance Evaluation of IRWR
IRWR improves k-dash by over 5.1x (resp. 4.4x). This is
because IRWR reuses the old information in G for incrementally updating proximities via vector scaling and additions,
without the need for expensive LU decomposition of k-dash.
(b) IRWR always is better than B LIN by nearly one order of
magnitude as B LIN requires costly block matrix inversions.
(c) IRWR outperforms IncPPR for over 95% of insertions, due
to the extra cost of IncPPR for doing short random walks.
(d) IRWR is sensitive to |ΔG| as the larger |ΔG| is, the larger
the aﬀected area is, so is the computation cost, as expected.
Fixing |V |=50K on synthetic data, we varied |E| from
280K to 350K (resp. from 350K to 280K) in 10K increments
(resp. decrements). The results are shown in Figures 2(c)
and 2(d), respectively, analogous to those on real datasets.
2) Exactness. To measure IRWR accuracy, we adopted NDCGl
(Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) for ranking top-l
node proximities with l = 20, 40, 60, and chose the ranking
results of k-dash as the benchmark, due to its exactness. The
results on p2p-Gnutella and cit-HepPh are reported in Figures
2(e) and 2(f), indicating that IRWR never scariﬁes accuracy
for achieving high eﬃciency, superior to other approaches.

CONCLUSIONS

We showed how RWR proximities can be computed very
eﬃciently in an incremental update model, where the edges
of a graph are constantly changed. We also empirically evaluated that IRWR greatly outperforms the other approaches
on both real and synthetic graphs without loss of exactness.
Our future work will further predict up to what fraction of
updated edges IRWR is faster than its batch counterparts.
