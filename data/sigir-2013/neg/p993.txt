We show that mobile query logs can provide insights on search interests and concerns before patients arrive at a healthcare facility,
as they wait or receive treatment, and after they depart.
Population-level utilization analyses: Public organizations such as
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) compute
statistics on healthcare utilization. We explore the possibility of using mobile query logs to complement traditional tracking and monitoring as a low cost means of estimating the statistics of HU.
Patient-specific predictions: We show that signals from mobile
search logs can predict the duration of a forthcoming stay at medical facilities, enabling such applications as patient triage.

ABSTRACT
Mobile devices provide people with a conduit to the rich information resources of the Web. With consent, the devices can also
provide streams of information about search activity and location
that can be used in population studies and real-time assistance. We
analyzed geotagged mobile queries in a privacy-sensitive study of
potential transitions from health information search to in-world
healthcare utilization. We note differences in people’s health information seeking before, during, and after the appearance of evidence
that a medical facility has been visited. We find that we can accurately estimate statistics about such potential user engagement with
healthcare providers. The findings highlight the promise of using
geocoded search for sensing and predicting activities in the world.

and Retrieval – search process, information filtering.

We first describe the procedure by which we estimate HU events
from geocoded mobile query logs. We then present several different uses of these inferred visits. We characterize behavior before,
during, and after an inferred visit, estimating visit statistics, and
predicting the duration of a user’s stay at a medical facility.

Mobile search; healthcare utilization; query logs.

A key premise of our study is that we can identify when users are
likely visiting healthcare facilities and/or engaging with healthcare
professionals. We begin by describing the datasets we use in our
study and the methods we used to infer utilization.

Categories and Subject Descriptors

1. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
Mobile devices allow people to search the Web as they travel and
engage in the physical world. The devices can serve as large-scale
sensor networks for population-wide studies of behavior and the
environment. Mobile devices that sense location have the ability to
provide information on connections between online activities and
activities in physical world. In recent work, researchers demonstrated how a log of geocoded mobile queries could be harnessed
in a privacy-sensitive manner to make inferences about how health
search evolves into transitions in location that appear to represent
healthcare utilization (HU) [9]. Other sources such as queries [2],
blogs [5], and social media [6] have been used as spatiotemporal
sensors, but none offer the clear relationship between virtual and
physical spaces as do geocoded mobile queries. We show how such
logs can be applied to extend prior studies and can provide new
insights about healthcare utilization from mobile logs.

2.1 Data
We collected datasets with consent via a widely available application provided by a major mobile search provider. The application
runs on the Android and iPhone platforms. Users agreed to share
their search activities and location information per a published privacy statement, which grants uses of the data to the provider for
internal analysis and service improvement. We used automated
tools to process the data in the aggregate. In this process, all data
were stripped of individually identifiable information. Direct location information was removed and not used in the analysis.
We used a dataset spanning one year of activity from approximately
30K users who had agreed to share their search activities and location information. The log consists of several hundred thousand
search entries stored on a secure server. Each entry corresponds to
a search interaction with a mobile application issued by an anonymized user, represented by a unique numerical identifier. Entries
contain the search query, the time, and GPS location when the
query was submitted. Location information was recorded only if
and when a search query was issued. The absolute locations of users
were removed. As in [9], only the distance between the user and
the location of medical facilities was stored. To compute the distances, we obtained the GPS coordinates of medical facilities across
the United States through a crawl of business listings, which includes data from a variety of sources such as the Yellow Pages
(yp.com). The database of facilities contains 34,750 medical facility sites. Site types include emergency medical and surgical services (54.7%), hospitals (34.1%), medical centers (10.5%), and outpatient services (0.6%). As we sought to understand long-term
search patterns, we removed users with < 90 days of search history.

Given estimates of HU events derived from mobile queries issued
to a Web search engine, we identify and monitor the following:

of behavior with people’s health information seeking over time [8].

2.2 Evidence of Healthcare Utilization
Drugs

To identify searchers who may be utilizing medical facilities, we
consider the spatial context in which a medical query was issued.
We only consider whether people searched for medical information
from within a certain distance (200 meters in our case) from a medical facility, following methods used and evaluated in [9]. In particular, we consider non-periodic proximity to a medical facility as
salient evidence of healthcare utilization (EHU). We further characterize engagements with healthcare facilities with information
about whether the GPS signal was available; GPS is generally
available outside but is often lost when indoors. We assume that
searches may occur within a healthcare facility when a GPS signal
is not attainable for a period of time (e.g., from 30 minutes to a few
days) following observation of EHU. Types of engagements at a
medical facility include seeking treatment, visiting an admitted patient, and accompanying a patient. For simplicity we shall refer to
all of these activities as healthcare utilization. In our data set, 5239
users (14.8% of the total number) queried from within 200 meters
of the medical facility at least once, providing evidence of HU.
Note that although the proximal query provides a useful way of estimating HU, this mechanism may introduce population bias (e.g.,
these users may be younger or more technologically savvy).

medical dictionary. To improve coverage, we also include the
synonyms of each symptom, which are identified via a two-step
random walk on the click-graph of a search engine [3].
• Body-part names. We use a list of major appendages and organs as body-part names obtained from reviews of web sites on
human anatomy [4], and track them in queries. Body parts can
be related to symptoms (e.g., chest pain), treatments (e.g., kidney transplant), or outcomes (e.g., back pain after surgery).
• Benign and serious conditions. We also look for the presence
of benign or serious medical conditions in queries, which are
extracted based on the list of conditions in [4] and their synonyms. Condition-related queries can indicate hypothesis-directed search such as pursuing a diagnosis given symptoms or
seeking additional information about certain conditions.
• Healthcare utilization intentions (HUI). We also track queries that demonstrate pursuit of in-world healthcare, such as
searches for a clinic or hospital. Such HUI searches may arise
as information seeking about symptoms or diagnostic hypotheses escalates to the pursuit of in-world resources [7].
• Drugs. We define a set of common medications and monitor
the presence of them in search queries. Medications are directly
related to treatment and remedy of symptoms and disorders.
Queries are classified into one of these categories via a white-listbased string-match classifier. When a query has overlap with multiple categories, we assign it to the category with highest overlap.

2.3 Error Reduction
We seek to make inferences about HU from the log, which serves
as a noisy and sparse sensor; we cannot completely resolve uncertainty about whether the EHUs as defined actually represent a visit
or a true engagement. Given the nature of the logs, we were unable
to distinguish between users visiting the medical facility for treatment, to visit or escort an admitted patient, or simply working at or
traveling near the facility but not using its health-related services.
To reduce the likelihood of errors, we require that users had previously searched for at least one of a set of tracked symptoms or synonyms from the Merck medical dictionary in the 90 days before the
EHU visit, demonstrating a health interest or concern. In total, 4006
of the 5239 users (76.5%) met this requirement. To improve the
likelihood that observed EHU events were related to treatment and
consultation, we removed the 885 users (22.1%) who had queried
from within 200 meters of the facility in the time period before the
first symptom query and who had queried frequently near a facility
(where more than 30 of the 90 days of search activities occurred
within 200m of a facility). These users may live near the facility,
may work at or near the facility or be receiving long-term care at
the facility, and would hence not be relevant to our focus on transitions from Web search to in-world healthcare utilization.

For each searcher demonstrating EHU, we divide search sequences
into three phases, i.e., before, during (i.e., user queries near a medical facility and the GPS signal is unavailable or “dark,” suggesting
that they are indoors), and after the assumed HU. We track the dynamics of the searcher’s intent by computing the fraction of their
search queries on the aforementioned five categories in each phase.
The average dynamics over all users with EHU are depicted in Figure 1. The figure shows the fraction of all observed queries that fall
into each phase before, during, and after the visit. For example,
0.1% of queries observed before and after the EHU contain symptoms, but 0.18% of the queries during the visit are associated with
symptoms. There are a number of noteworthy patterns in the terminological shifts between the three phases:
1. More searching symptoms and human anatomy when users are
close to a medical facility (within 200m and GPS dark) than far
away from it, suggesting that searchers have stronger interest
and concerns about health when searching near a hospital.
2. There is a stronger interest in HUIs prior to the visit to the facility
and this diminishes dramatically once the user reaches the facility (dropping to nearly half the pre-visit level). Since the EHU is

3. ANALYZING UTILIZATION
Given an estimate for HU from mobile search logs, we analyze aspects of this activity, specifically studying the dynamics of search
intent surrounding the EHU visit. We now characterize intentions
and seek to predict the duration for each inferred visit.

3.1 Search Intent Dynamics
We first explore the dynamics of health-related search goals that
may be attributed to inferred HU. Specifically, as a user’s health
condition evolves (e.g., from normal, to ill (or concerned about an
illness), to recovered), or engagement status changes (e.g., from approaching a facility, to engaging with a healthcare practitioner, to
departing a facility), how is their search behavior affected? We target the presence of the following health signals in mobile queries:
•

Symptoms. Symptom queries can capture the onset of medical
concerns. We label a query as symptom-related if it contains at
least one symptom term (e.g., “twitching”, “headache”). The
list of possible symptoms is extracted from the online Merck

based on the GPS location and not the query content, this transition provides strong evidence of HU.
3. We observe changes in the mix of health-related search goals as
people transition to different phases of engagement. In particular,
users were observed searching significantly more often for conditions (doubled) before the assumed engagement than in the
other phases, anatomical names (tripled) and symptoms (doubled) during engagement than other phases, and drug names
(seven times higher) following the visit.
4. We believe that the transition from conditions and HUI (before
engagement), to symptoms and body-parts (during engagement),
and eventually to treatments and drug names (after engagement)
reflects shifts in information needs over the course of healthcare
engagement episodes. The mobile query logs appear to reflect
patients moving from concerns and questions about their conditions, to those of diagnosis and symptoms, and eventually to
treatments and post-visit recovery.

Although these findings may be unsurprising, they show that sensing is to some extent reliable and highlight the potential value of
geocoded query analysis for linking online intent with in-world use.
We also examined how healthcare engagement influences searchers’ medical concerns. As an example, we sought to understand
how evidence of engagement with a healthcare professional might
lead to signs of resolution of concerns. One way to do this is by
examining if and how the frequency of question words (i.e., what,
which, when, why, how, and who) in medical queries changes with
the phase of the engagement. One might expect to see that users
have more uncertainty and questions before, and perhaps during,
the early portion of healthcare engagement than after it. We did not
observe significant changes in the use of question words in mobile
medical queries over the course of the engagement. One explanation is that while the engagement may address some concerns, it
also raises others. We observed that queries issued during engagement were on average more technical than in other scenarios, suggesting that users may adopt terminology from discussions with
healthcare professionals, or seek the meaning of specialist terms
encountered. We shall investigate query technicality in more detail.

device first received a signal was at t4. Our estimate of start time ts
= (t1 + t2)/2, estimated end time te = (t3 + t4)/2, and estimated duration ∆t = te – ts. The measurement error e = (t2-t1)/2 + (t4-t3)/2. The
relative measurement error E = e/∆t. To mitigate the measurement
error, we perform explicit filtering by removing all EHU events
whose relative measurement errors exceed 20%.
The duration estimates that we obtain from our mobile search log
analysis are provided in Table 1. Since the time that people spend
at a facility is influenced by the type of facility (e.g., people may
tend to spend more time in inpatient facilities than outpatient centers), we split our analysis into urgent care facilities and hospitals.
For reference purposes, the CDC statistics on durations at each of
the two facility types are also provided [1]. We can clearly see from
Table 1 that estimates of durations of engagement times from the
mobile search logs resonate well with the CDC statistics.

3.2 Estimating Visit Durations

3.3 Forecasting Visit Durations

We now consider estimations of durations of engagements at medical facilities. The primary focus in this analysis is in comparing the
statistics obtained from the mobile search log to ground truth provided by the CDC. The CDC statistics are based on outpatient records, collected from a range of medical facilities across the US.

Given the accuracy with which we were able to estimate durations,
we explored the use of predictive models to estimate the duration
of an upcoming healthcare engagement based on a searcher’s preengagement search behavior. These predictive models might be
used one day for assistance in clinically-relevant forecasting tasks,
such as helping medical facilities triage patients before their arrival.
The features we used in our predictions are listed in Table 2. We
breakout EHU into any EHU (query proximal to a medical facility)
and indoor EHU (query proximal to medical facility and GPS signal has gone dark, suggesting that they are inside the facility at
query time). Note that prior utilization or engagement features are
computed using search activity > 12 hours before each engagement
to reduce the likelihood of overlap with the engagement itself.

Since we only have access to location information when users enter
queries, we are uncertain about exact time a user enters or leaves a
facility. Figure 2 shows an example of a visit to a medical facility,
defined in the figure as time period where the user’s GPS signal is
dark (i.e., they are likely indoors). Assume the last query before
engagement that the searcher issued when the GPS signal is available (light) was at time t1, the first query when their GPS is unavailable (dark) was at time t2, the last query issued at dark was at
time t3 and the first query after engagement issued when their GPS

the 25 features (Table 2). We used a linear regression model with
L2 regularization and a generalized linear model (GLM) with a reciprocal link function (i.e., assuming that the duration follows an
exponential distribution rather than normal) and L2 regularization.
The models were trained and tested based on a leave-one-out crossvalidation, where the relative error compared to the estimated duration was used as the evaluation metric. The prediction results are
reported in Figure 4. Promisingly, they show that the GLM attains
a prediction accuracy close to the measurement error. To better understand the engagement duration, Table 3 lists the top 10 most important features and their weights (normalized against the most important feature). The analysis shows that query technicality and previous EHUs are the strongest predictors, but other features such as
facility type and general medical searching are also important.

One important feature that we mentioned earlier is query technicality, which captures the sophistication of the medical terminology
used by a searcher. We implemented a query technicality estimator
based on a statistical language model similar to the approach described in [10]. The technicality model was learned from a large
corpus comprising medical documents from domains of different
technicality (e.g., PubMed, MeSH, CDC, WebMD, and medical
search queries issued on Bing.com). Technicality estimations for
queries are not accepted if the confidence is low. The technicality
estimator enables us to track the specificity of a searcher’s medical
concerns over the course of HU. Figure 3 plots the temporal dynamics of a searcher’s query technicality during an engagement. As
a reference, the normal level of query technicality for each user (independent of the visit) is also given as “all” in Figure 3. We can see
the visit to the facility influences query technicality, suggesting that
there may be exposure to technical terminology at the facility that
emerges in query streams. Technicality also trends slightly downward over time, suggesting that most of the effect on query behavior occurs within a short time of the visit beginning. One explanation is diagnoses may be rendered soon after arrival of the patient.

4. CONCLUSIONS
Using geotagged mobile searches as sensors for healthcare utilization, we explore health seeking behavior and seek to identify engagements with professional health providers. We also use search
activity to estimate durations of healthcare utilization for different
facility types and find strong agreement with CDC statistics. We
use mobile search logs to predict engagement durations, considering medical search histories and prior engagement information. We
are enthusiastic about the promise of the methods described in this
paper, and envision privacy-sensitive applications that could provide value in the healthcare domain and beyond.

A key challenge in our prediction is a lack of supervised data. We
do not have access to the ground truth (e.g., the exact duration) of
the potential engagements. For example, assuming a healthcare engagement for which the log-based estimation of duration is four
hours with a measurement error of three hours, the true duration
could be any value between one and seven hours. We know that we
are grappling with substantial and unavoidable measurement errors.
We cannot overcome the errors with our methodology. To make
our prediction tractable, we removed engagement sessions with excessive measurement errors. Particularly, we require that for each
engagement, the start distance and end distance, i.e., the distances
at which the searcher issued a query when the engagement
started/ended, are at most 150m and one mile respectively from the
facility. This restriction results in 179 EHU sessions, with an average measurement error (defined in previous section) of 83.86%.
The duration prediction task can be formulated naturally as a regression problem, i.e., given the features extracted from the preengagement search activities, we seek to predict the duration of an
engagement. We experimented with two regression models with
