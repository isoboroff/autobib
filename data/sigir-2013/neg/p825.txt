thus need a more ﬂexible notion of implication between d
and q for reﬂecting this uncertainty. We need to estimate
the degree of implication or the uncertainty of implication,
denoted P (d → q).
We mainly focus, in this paper, on Van Rijsbergen’s study
[16]. Van Rijsbergen presented a special logical framework,
namely Conditional Logic, and he claimed that the appropriate implication for representing the retrieval decision is a
type of logical implication d → q diﬀerent from the material
implication d ⊃ q.
According to Van Rijsbergen [16], the implication d → q is
formalised as follows: ‘if d is true then q’. He also assumed
that the uncertainty could be estimated by the conditional
probability:

Logic-based Information Retrieval (IR) models represent the
retrieval decision as a logical implication d → q between a
document d and a query q, where d and q are logical sentences. However, d → q is a binary decision, we thus need a
measure to estimate the degree to which d implies q, denoted
P (d → q). In this study, we revisit the Van Rijsbergen’s assumptions [16] about: 1- the logical implication ‘→’ is not
the material one ‘⊃’, and 2- P (d → q) could be estimated
by the conditional probability P (q|d). More precisely, we
claim that the material implication is an appropriate implication for IR, and also we mathematically prove that replacing P (d → q) by P (q|d) is a correct choice. In order to prove
the Van Rijsbergen’s assumption, we use the Propositional
Logic and the Lattice theory. We also exploit the notion of
degree of implication that is proposed by Knuth [7].

P (d → q) = P (q|d)

(1)

Van Rijsbergen’s assumption about estimating P (d → q)
depending on P (q|d) was intuitive.
In this study, we discuss and claim that the retrieval decision could be modeled by the material implication d ⊃ q,
and then we propose a proof for Van Rijsbergen’s assumption.
We choose the Propositional Logic (PL) as the underling
logical framework to represent documents, queries, and the
retrieval decision. It is known that PL corresponds to a lattice [6]. Moreover, Knuth [7] deﬁned a degree of implication
or inclusion on lattices. It is then possible to exploit the
lattice structure and Knuth’s notion of the degree of implication for estimating P (d → q).
The paper is structured as follows: in section 2, we give a
brief survey about the diﬀerent types of logics that are used
for building logic-based IR models. We also present some of
the techniques that are used for estimating the uncertainty
of a logical implication. We mainly discuss, in section 3,
the validity of our hypothesis about replacing the logical
implication d → q by the material one d ⊃ q. In section
4, we present a proof for the Van Rijsbergen’s assumption,
which concerns estimating P (d → q) using the conditional
probability P (q|d). We conclude in section 5. The appendix
A reviews the mathematical basics that are necessary to
understand the mathematics of the paper.

1. INTRODUCTION
Many studies [16, 11, 3, 10, 4, 9] showed that Information
Retrieval (IR) can be represented as a logical implication
d → q, where d represents a document and it is a logical
sentence in a speciﬁc logic, and q represents a query and it
is also a logical sentence in the same logic of d.
Using the logical implication d → q for representing the
retrieval decision is quite limited, because d → q is a binary decision, i.e. either d implies q or not. However, IR
is an uncertain process [3], because: 1- q is an imperfect
representation of user needs, 2- d is also an imperfect representation of the content of documents, and 3- relevance
judgement depends on external factors, e.g. the user. We

2. LOGIC-BASED IR MODELS
Logic-based IR models state that d and q are logical sentences in a speciﬁc logic. In addition, d should be retrieved

by Conceptual Graph, for representing d, q, and d → q.
They also use the notion of conceptual graph projection for
estimating P (d → q).
Losada et al. [9] and Abdulahhad et al. [1] use the Propositional Logic, and they use the notion of model intersection
for estimating P (d → q).
The choice of the appropriate logic depends on its expressive power and the complexity of its deduction algorithms, where there is a trade-oﬀ between the expressive
power and deduction algorithm complexity. For a more complete picture about the type of logic and the way of estimating P (d → q) refers to [8, 4].

reviews the diﬀerent stands of what d → q actually means
in IR ﬁeld. He illustrates that there are ﬁve diﬀerent stands
presented in IR literatures: 1- d → q is true in some particular interpretations, denoted M |= d → q where M is a
subset of interpretations, 2- q is a logical consequence of d,
denoted Md |= q where Md is the set of models of d, 3- d → q
is valid, denoted |= d → q, 4- q is provable from d, denoted
d  q, and 5- d → q is a theorem, denoted  d → q. It is also
possible to add one more stand, 6- d → q is provable from a
pre-deﬁned set of sentences F , denoted F  d → q. Points
1, 2, and 3 are model-theoretic notions, whereas, points 4, 5,
and 6 are proof-theoretic notions.
The most general deﬁnition of the logical implication d →
q was formalized as a condition of the form: ‘if d is true
then q’ [16, 3]. However, there are some studies that translated d → q into diﬀerent forms, e.g. Conceptual Graph
ordering [2], concept subsumption [10, 14]. Van Rijsbergen
[16] formalized the implication ‘→’, as follows: for any two
sentences or sets of sentences X and Y , X → Y means that
’if X is true then Y ’. In other words, if both X and Y are
true under an interpretation then X → Y is also true under
that interpretation. The truth of X → Y does not simply
depend on the evaluation of X and Y in one interpretation.
Chiaramella et al. [3], by their turn, formalized the implication ‘→’, as follows: D → Q is true iﬀ Q is true given that
D is true. Both [16, 3] are compatible with stand 4 [15].
In general, IR is an uncertain process [3], so we need to
evaluate the uncertainty of d → q. Van Rijsbergen [16] and
Nie [11] depend on the Possible Worlds semantic to evaluate
the uncertainty of an implication P (d → q). More precisely,
according to Van Rijsbergen [16], the P (d → q) could be
replaced by the conditional probability P (q|d), whereas, Nie
[11] depends on the notion of distance between the possible
worlds over the path from d to q.
The assumption of Van Rijsbergen [16] about estimating
the logical implication uncertainty P (d → q) using the conditional probability P (q|d), is the most general form of uncertainty estimation and it is well accepted by the IR community. However, this assumption has no rigid theoretical
proof, and in this study, we present, for the ﬁrst time to our
knowledge, a theoretical proof for Van Rijsbergen’s assumption.
All studies that talked about representing the retrieval decision by a logical implication d → q, also presented some
methods to estimate the uncertainty P (d → q). Most of
proposals for estimating the value of P (d → q) are complex,
e.g. Conceptual Graph projection, Possible Worlds semantic. However, there were a few studies, e.g. [9, 1], presented
practical and simple algorithms. Concerning the type of
logic, a wide range of logics have been used to represent d,
q, and consequently d → q.
Nie [12, 13] uses the Modal Logic, and he uses the notion
of Possible Worlds and the relations between them for estimating P (d → q). In [13], he also uses the probability
besides possible worlds for estimating P (d → q).
Meghini et al. [10] and Sebastiani [14] use the Description Logic, and they use the notion of possible worlds and the
denotational semantic of description logic beside the probability for estimating P (d → q).
Crestani et al. [5] also use the Modal Logic, but they use
the Logical Imaging technique, which is probability dependent, for estimating P (d → q).
Chevallet et al. [2] use the First-Order Logic, represented

THE TYPE OF IMPLICATION

In this study, we use the Propositional Logic PL as underlying logic. Therefore, any logical sentence s is a logical
sentence under PL, and it is built depending on a set of
atomic propositions. The set of atomic propositions is the
set of indexing terms. In other words, every term t is an
atomic proposition, and t is true for a speciﬁc document
d means that t indexes d, or equivalently, d is about t [15].
Documents and queries are logical sentences built depending
on terms.
All studies [16, 11, 3, 8, 9] claim that the implication
‘→’ is diﬀerent from the classic material implication ‘⊃’. In
addition, ‘→’ is more appropriate than ‘⊃’ for IR. In this
paper, we claim that the two implications ‘→’ and ‘⊃’ are
equivalent for IR.
All deﬁnitions of the implication d → q, depicted in [16,
11, 3, 9], agree that d → q can only be evaluated in the
interpretations where the antecedent d is true and in those
interpretations if the consequent q is also true then d → q
is true. In other words, the evaluation space for d → q is
restricted to the interpretations that make d true, whereas
the evaluation space of d ⊃ q contains all possible interpretations.
The main problem in those studies was the inability to
imagine the meaning of d → q when d is false, where d
represents a document and q represents a query. However,
the impossibility of imagining some thing is not a suﬃcient
reason for not modeling that thing. In other words, d → q
when d is false is a part of the model even if this case is not
an existing case.
First of all, we should clarify what ‘d is false’ actually
means. To discuss ‘d is false’, we have two cases:
• d is false under a speciﬁc interpretation i, denoted
{i} |= d. In principle, IR systems try to evaluate the
logical implication d → q, more precisely, they start
from d as a starting point and try to check if it implies
q or not. In other words, to evaluate d → q, there is
an evaluation space which is the set of all possible interpretations I. Normally, I is a very large set and IR
systems do not check the validity of d → q under all
interpretations I, instead of that, they reduce the evaluation space I to a subset of interpretations Md ⊆ I,
where Md |= d are the set of models of d, and in most
of the cases Md only contains one interpretation. They
do that because they start the search from d, so there
is no need to check the interpretations where d is false.
• |= d, which means that d is false under all possible
interpretations, or in other words, either d contains a
contradiction of the form . . . t ∧ ¬t . . . where t is an

two implications d → q and d ⊃ q interchangeably.

indexing term, or d is an empty document. In both
cases, d is trivial and we do not normally face these
cases in real IR systems.

4. THE IMPLICATION UNCERTAINTY AS
CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY

From the previous discussion, it is possible to say that the
cases where d is false are not existing cases. Therefore, even
if we integrate them in our model that will not change any
thing because we do not face these cases in real IR systems.
We explained why the cases where ‘d is false’ are not existing. However, the main goal of IR systems is to check the
validity of |= d → q, rather than studying the exact deﬁnition of the implication d → q. In the rest of this section,
we present a mathematical proof showing that d → q is a
special case of d ⊃ q. We can discuss our assumption about
replacing d → q by d ⊃ q in a more formal way, as follows:

As we mentioned, modeling the retrieval decision as an
implication d → q is quite limited, because d → q is a binary decision (T or F ). Therefore, we need a metric for
estimating the degree of implication between d and q, denoted P (d → q).
If d and q are two logical sentences then they correspond
to two distinct nodes Md and Mq in BM , where BM is the
lattice of models (Appendix A). BM is built depending on
the power set of the set of interpretations, not depending
on the set of interpretations. We also know that BM is a
Boolean algebra, so for any two nodes M1 and M2 in BM ,
the z(M1 , M2 ) function (equation 8) is the conditional probability P (M1 |M2 ) (equation 9).
On the one hand, it is possible to replace P (d → q) by
z(Mq , Md ), because:

Point 1: (Md→q ) vs. (Md⊃q ).
From the traditional truth table, the material implication
d ⊃ q is true, when, either d and q are true, or d is false.
Therefore, the set of models of d ⊃ q is Md⊃q :
Md⊃q = (Md ∩ Mq ) ∪ Md

(2)

• z(Mq , Md ) = 1 when Md ⊆ Mq which means |= d → q.

where Md |= d is the set of models of d, Mq |= q is the set of
models of q, and Md = I \ Md is the set of interpretations
that make d false.
According to the deﬁnition of d → q, which is presented
in [16, 3], d → q is true under a speciﬁc interpretation iﬀ d
and q are true under that interpretation. Thus, the set of
models of d → q is Md→q :
Md→q = Md ∩ Mq

• z(Mq , Md ) = 0 when Md ∩ Mq = φ which means that
there is no interpretation that makes both d and q true,
or equivalently, d contradicts q or vice-versa.
• 0 < z(Md , Mq ) < 1 otherwise, where Md and Mq are
the set of models of d and q, respectively.

(3)

Therefore, P (d → q) = P (Mq |Md ). On the other hand, we
A
know that each node M ∈ 2(2 ) in the Boolean algebra BM
represents a set of models of a set of logically-equivalent sentences. By this way, Mq is a set of models of a set of logical
sentences equivalent to q. We choose q as a representative to
this equivalent class. We do the same thing for d. Therefore,

From equations 2 and 3, we can see that d → q is a special
case of d ⊃ q.

Point 2: (|= d → q ) vs. (|= d ⊃ q ).

From the deﬁnition of d ⊃ q, we know that:
(|= d ⊃ q) ⇔ (Md ⊆ Mq )

(4)

P (d → q) = z(Mq , Md ) = P (Mq |Md ) = P (q|d)

The implication d → q is also equivalent to the set inclusion between models:
(Md |= d → q) ⇔ (Md ⊆ Mq )

(6)

Equation (6) justiﬁes the deﬁnition of P (d → q) that is
presented by Van Rijsbergen [16]. To our knowledge, this
is the ﬁrst study that presents a formal justiﬁcation of the
Van Rijsbergen’s assumption.

(5)

That is correct because:
• Md |= d → q means that ‘if d is true then q’, or every
model of d should also be a model of q [16, 3], and
consequently Md ⊆ Mq .
• Md ⊆ Mq means that when d is true then q is also
true, and consequently Md |= d → q.

5. CONCLUSION
This study presents a new vision of logic-based IR models through exploiting the implicit link between lattices and
Propositional Logic.
We use the Propositional Logic for representing documents and queries, and then we claim that the retrieval
decision corresponds to the material implication between a
document and a query. After that, we position documents
and queries on a lattice, more precisely on a Boolean algebra.
We then exploit the degree of implication metric z, deﬁned
on the lattice, for representing the ranking mechanism.
Our model provides a theoretical proof for the deﬁnition
of P (d → q) that is presented by Van Rijsbergen [16]. To our
knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study that mathematically proves
the Van Rijsbergen’s assumption about replacing P (d → q)
by P (q|d).
The next step of this study will be to exploit the potential
capabilities of Propositional Logic and the Lattice theory in
order to build a new, general, and practical IR model.

From Point 1 and Point 2, we can see that: On the one
hand, d → q is a special case of d ⊃ q. On the other hand,
we showed that the cases when d is false Md are not existing
cases. Therefore, it is possible to assume that d → q and
d ⊃ q are equivalent in IR ﬁeld. Actually, the goal of IR
systems is to check if d → q is true or not, or in other words,
to check the validity of Md ⊆ Mq .
Depending on the previous discussion, it is possible to replace d → q by d ⊃ q for modeling the retrieval decision. In
the next section, we illustrate how P (d ⊃ q), or equivalently
P (d → q), can be replaced by P (q|d), which corresponds the
Van Rijsbergen’s assumption [16].
After the previous discussion our main hypothesis is: the
material implication d ⊃ q is an appropriate implication for

We deﬁne A = {a1 , . . . , an } as a set of all atomic propositions. The set A forms our alphabet, and it is a ﬁnite set
|A| = n. Any proposition ai ∈ A can take only one of two
possible values: True T , or False F .
We say that a sentence s is provable from a set of sentences
F , denoted F  s, when s can be obtained by applying inference rules to the axioms of the logic and the set of sentences
F . Moreover,  s means that s can be obtained by applying
inference rules to the axioms of the logic.
In PL, a semantic is given to a logical sentence s by assigning a truth value (T or F ) to each atomic proposition in s.
In this manner, each logical sentence s has several interpretations depending on the truth value of its propositions. The
subset Ms of interpretations that makes s true is called the
set of models of s, denoted Ms |= s. Moreover, |= s means
that s is a tautology or it is true in all interpretations, and
|= s means that s is false in all interpretations. According
to this formalism, we deﬁne any model m ∈ Ms of s as a set
of atomic propositions that have T as truth value[9]. In this
A
manner, Ms ∈ 2(2 ) , where 2x is the power set of the set x.
In addition, for any two sentences s1 and s2 , |= (s1 ⊃ s2 ) is
equivalent to Ms1 ⊆ Ms2 , where ⊃ is the material implication. The two symbols  and |= are metalanguage symbols
and they are not part of the logic.

Degree of Inclusion

In any lattice (L, ∧, ∨) and for any two elements x, y ∈ L,
even that x does not include y, it is possible to describe the
degree to which x includes y. Knuth [7] generalizes the inclusion to the degree of inclusion represented by real numbers.
He introduced the z function:
⎧
if x ≥ y
⎨ 1
0
if x ∧ y = ⊥
(8)
∀x, y ∈ L, z(x, y) =
⎩ z
otherwise, 0 < z < 1
where z(x, y) quantiﬁes the degree to which x includes y.
Knuth [7] says: “The motivation here is that, if we are certain that x includes y then we want to indicate this knowledge. However, if we know that x does not include y, then
we can quantify the degree to which x includes y”.
The z function is simply the probability when it is deﬁned
on a Boolean algebra (L, ∧, ∨, ¬, , ⊥) [7]:
