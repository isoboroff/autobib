ABSTRACT

billions of keywords, tens of millions of ads, billions of users,
millions of advertisers where events such as clicks and actions can be extremely rare. For such a complex problem,
conventional technologies and evaluation methodologies are
not sufficient. With the dramatically developing Internet
advertising industry, it is the right time to organize a workshop to share and discuss the new thoughts, algorithms, and
theories in this area.
Internet advertising is one of the most important monetization engines of the Internet. It is highly associated with
many IR applications such as web portals, search engines,
social networks, e-commerce, mobile networks and apps, etc.
Researchers in information retrieval, machine learning, data
mining, and game theory are developing creative ideas to
advance the technologies in this area.

Internet advertising, a form of advertising that utilizes the
Internet to deliver marketing messages and attract customers,
has seen exponential growth since its inception around twenty
years ago; it has been pivotal to the success of the World
Wide Web. The dramatic growth of internet advertising
poses great challenges to information retrieval, machine learning, data mining and game theory, and it calls for novel technologies to be developed. The main purpose of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners in
the area of Internet Advertising and enable them to share
their latest research results, to express their opinions, and
to discuss future directions.

MOTIVATION

Internet advertising is a complex problem. It contains
multiple parties including advertisers, users, publishers, ad
agencies, and ad platforms such as ad exchanges. It is highly
dynamic in terms of the rapid change of user information
needs, non-stationary bids of advertisers, and the frequent
modifications of ads campaigns. It is very large scale, with
