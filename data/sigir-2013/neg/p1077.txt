ABSTRACT

nally, all other people taking part in political discussions we group
together as the rest: the public.
In this demonstrator we describe ThemeStreams: an interactive
visualization aimed at giving insight into the ownership and dynamics of themes being discussed, thereby enabling users to answer questions such as Who put this issue on the map? ThemeStreams allows users to explore streams of tweets, either from a
fixed set of predefined themes or through a search box. It uses
stream graphs [1] to indicated how influencer groups discuss a theme,
thereby depicting the “aliveness” and ownership of a topic. Our visualization indicates when somebody said something, which influencer group this person belongs to, and it takes into account how
many people react to a statement to estimate the “size” and “lifetime” of a statement. ThemeStreams can be accessed at http:
//themestreams.xtas.net/.

The political landscape is fluid. Discussions are always ongoing
and new “hot topics” continue to appear in the headlines. But what
made people start talking about that topic? And who started it?
Because of the speed at which discussions sometimes take place
this can be difficult to track down. We describe ThemeStreams:
a demonstrator that maps political discussions to themes and influencers and illustrate how this mapping is used in an interactive
visualization that shows us which themes are being discussed, and
that helps us answer the question “Who put this issue on the map?"
in streams of political data.

DATA AND BACKEND

For this demonstrator of ThemeStreams we focus on the Dutch
political landscape. In the last couple of years Twitter has gained
enormous popularity within Dutch politics, and is seen as an important outlet for talking about politics. Many politicians are actively
using twitter and journalists regularly quote tweets in live television broadcasts. For this ThemeStreams demonstrator we therefore
actively follow the following influencer groups:

INTRODUCTION

Over the past couple of years, politics and politicians have discovered social media as important means for communicating with
voters and for influencing public opinion. Keeping track of the
many discussion forums and other outlets is no trivial matter. What
themes are being discussed? Who introduced a theme? Who “owns”
it? Typical politically relevant themes include: the economy, healthcare, defense, foreign policy. According to a leading communication agency, during recent national elections in The Netherlands
discussions revolved around approx. 500 issues, with differing levels and patterns of attention.
The participants of political discussions can often be mapped to
a select number of so-called influencer groups. Specifically, one
can identify the following four groups. First, there are those who
currently actively have an (important) position within the governing body, the politicians. Second, there are those who lobby for
(specific) important issues, the lobbyists. Third, there are journalists who specialize in politics as well as other high profile media
influencers such as television stars or columnists. Fourth and fi-

• politicians (ministers, members of parliament, but also the
local ranks of politicians in municipalities and provinces);
• journalists (news paper journalists as well as TV presenters);
• lobbyists (people pushing the people who are active in politics);
• other influencers (these include (satirical) columnists, politically engaged celebrities or stand-up comedians).
Tweets for the four influencer groups are being collected since late
2011. At the time of writing, the index driving ThemeStreams contains over 3.9M tweets. The four influencer groups together make
up what we call the inner circle; it consists of about 1,400 individual users at the time of writing. In addition to the inner circle, we
also consider and crawl a group of followers of members of the inner circle, approximately 245,000 users who together make up the
outer circle. As we explain below, messages in the outer circle are
used to weigh the impact of messages in the inner circle.
For content extraction and cleaning, we use the xTAS text analysis service.1 For indexing, storage and retrieval we use ElasticSearch.2 We use a hand-tuned stop word list that also filters most

Initial usability studies have been carried out with colleagues and
with professional end users, media analysts working for a communication agent. The main findings show that ThemeStreams was
intuitive to understand, and inspection of parts of any query was
easy to do. The combined cloud proved to be more insightful for
fast overviews of the data. The individual clouds proved to be more
useful for inspecting relative word usage between the groups. We
also found a need for also depicting most represented speakers for
any one group. A more detailed user study is currently in the works,
and will be presented at a later time.

INTERACTION AND VISUALIZATION

Users can gain insights in the development of messages around
a topic in one of two ways. From the ThemeStreams home page
they can access a fixed list of predefined themes and then explore
streams of tweets around a theme they select. Alternatively, they
can enter a topic in a search box (item A in Fig. 2).
In response to a topic submitted by a user (either predefined or
ad-hoc), ThemeStreams displays a zoomable stream graph at the
top of the page (item B in Fig. 2), depicting the number of tweets
in the inner circle of four influencer groups retrieved for the topic.
The thickness of the stream at each point in time is weighed by their
“lifetime” (as determined by the number of retweets and mentions
these tweets have received). In this way, we provide insight into
how influential a group has been throughout the development of a
theme, who finds a particular theme important and who were the
first to talk about a particular theme.
Users can dive into more detail by zooming in using the focus +
context principle [2]. In part C in Fig. 2, users can select a specific
temporal interval, for instance because they know about important
events related to their topic or because they observe interesting phenomena in the zoomable stream graph in part B of the interface.
This allows users to not only see how important a theme was for
an influencer group, but also what words one group used that other
groups did not. To provide context, the stream graph for the entire
period is also visualized (in part C of the interface); this enables
rapid re-inspection of time periods close to the current focus.
The user’s selection (indicated with a grey area, see part C), triggers the following events in the interface: (1) the zoomable stream
graph in part B is restricted to the selected period and (2) in part
D a term cloud is generated based on the tweets in the selected
period. We offer two types of term cloud visualization selectable
through the buttons in part E: one with a separate cloud for each of
the influencer groups (see Fig. 3, right-hand side) and one with a
combined representation with different colors indicated which influencer group was most influential for the term shown (see Fig. 3,
left-hand side).3

CONCLUSION

We have presented ThemeStreams, an interactive visualization
for inspecting the political discourse over time using the Twitter
posts of four political influencer groups. Other suitable application
scenarios for ThemeStreams include discourse analysis over time
in other domains, such as news paper archives.
