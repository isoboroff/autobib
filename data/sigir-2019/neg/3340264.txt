ABSTRACT

BIOGRAPHY

One of the central problems of artificial intelligence is machine
perception, i.e., the ability to understand the visual world based on
input from sensors such as cameras. In this talk, I will present recent
progress of my team in this direction. I will start with presenting
results on how to generate additional training data using weak
annotations, motion information and synthetic data. Next, I will
discuss our results for action recognition in videos, where human
tubelets have shown to be successful. Our tubelet approach moves
away from state-of-the-art frame based approaches and improves
classification and localization by relying on joint information from
several frames. We show how to extend this type of method to
weakly supervised learning of actions, which allows us to scale to
large amounts of data with sparse manual annotation. Finally, I
will present recent work on grasping with a robot arm based on
learning long-horizon manipulations with a hierarchy of RL and
imitation-based skills.

Cordelia Schmid holds a M.S. degree in Computer Science from the
University of Karlsruhe and a Doctorate, also in Computer Science,
from the Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble (INPG). Her
doctoral thesis received the best thesis award from INPG in 1996.
Dr. Schmid was a post-doctoral research assistant in the Robotics
Research Group of Oxford University in 1996–1997. Since 1997 she
has held a permanent research position at Inria Grenoble RhoneAlpes, where she is a research director. Dr. Schmid has been an
Associate Editor for IEEE PAMI (2001–2005) and for IJCV (2004–
2012), editor-in-chief for IJCV (2013–2018), a program chair of IEEE
CVPR 2005 and ECCV 2012 as well as a general chair of IEEE CVPR
2015 and ECCV 2020. In 2006, 2014 and 2016, she was awarded the
Longuet-Higgins prize for fundamental contributions in computer
vision that have withstood the test of time. She is a fellow of IEEE.
She was awarded an ERC advanced grant in 2013, the Humbolt
research award in 2015 and the Inria & French Academy of Science Grand Prix in 2016. She was elected to the German National
Academy of Sciences, Leopoldina, in 2017. In 2018 she received the
Koenderink prize for fundamental contributions in computer vision
that have withstood the test of time. Starting 2018 she holds a joint
appointment with Google research.
