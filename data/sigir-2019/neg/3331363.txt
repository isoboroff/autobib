problems such as personalized music recommendation [13], song
popularity prediction, and genre identification [8].However, prior
works on style analysis and bias measurement are limited only to
the manual analysis of a few hundred songs. Such an approach
cannot scale to the analysis of millions of songs. These works also
fail to capitalize on recent advances in computational methods that
generate a semantic representation for natural language text. Our
work aims to fill this gap by applying these methods on a large
corpus of song lyrics scraped from online user-generated content.
There are two main takeaway results from our work. First, popular songs significantly differ from other songs when it comes to
the style of lyrics. This difference indicates that lyrics play a major
role in deciding the popularity of a song. Second, biases in song
lyrics correlate with biases measured in humans. This correlation
indicates that song lyrics reflect the existing biases in society. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that analyzes song
lyrics at the scale of half million lyrics to understand style and
bias. Our results are reproducible as all our code and datasets are
available publicly on the Web1 . We briefly review the related work
in Section 2. Our results are presented in Sections 3 and 4. Our
conclusion and future work are highlighted in Section 5.

ABSTRACT
The central idea of this paper is to gain a deeper understanding
of song lyrics computationally. We focus on two aspects: style
and biases of song lyrics. All prior works to understand these two
aspects are limited to manual analysis of a small corpus of song
lyrics. In contrast, we analyzed more than half a million songs
spread over five decades. We characterize the lyrics style in terms
of vocabulary, length, repetitiveness, speed, and readability. We
have observed that the style of popular songs significantly differs
from other songs. We have used distributed representation methods
and WEAT test to measure various gender and racial biases in the
song lyrics. We have observed that biases in song lyrics correlate
with prior results on human subjects. This correlation indicates
that song lyrics reflect the biases that exist in society. Increasing
consumption of music and the effect of lyrics on human emotions
makes this analysis important.

RELATED WORK

Song lyrics have been used for many tasks related to music mining such as genre identification and popularity prediction. Earlier
works considered lyrics as a weak source of song characteristics
as compared to auditory or social features. However, recent works
have shown the strength of lyrics for music mining. Barman et al.
have shown that knowledge encoded in lyrics can be utilized to
improve the distributed representation of words [2]. Mayer et al.
have introduced various features for lyrics processing [15]. Fell and
Sporleder presented a lyrics-based analysis of songs based on vocabulary and song structure [8]. Our work complements these works
by characterizing lyrics style using multiple attributes extracted
from lyrics.
Many studies have analyzed gender and racial biases in song
lyrics [14, 18]. However, such an approach of manual analysis cannot scale to millions of songs. Caliskan et al. proposed Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT) to computationally measure biases
in any text repository [5]. Their test quantifies biases by computing
similarity scores between various sets of words. To compute similarity, the WEAT test represents words using a distributed word
representation method such as fastText or word2vec [4, 16]. We
apply the WEAT test on song lyrics and discuss its implications.

INTRODUCTION

Music is an integral part of our culture. Smartphones and near
ubiquitous availability of the internet have resulted in dramatic
growth of online music consumption [17]. More than 85% of online
music subscribers search for song lyrics, indicating a keen interest
of people in song lyrics. Song lyrics have a significant impact on
human emotions and behavior. While listening to songs with violent
lyrics can increase aggressive thoughts and hostile feelings [1],
listening to songs with pro-social lyrics increased the accessibility
of pro-social thoughts, led to more interpersonal empathy, and
fostered helping behavior [10].
This paper is motivated by the observation that song lyrics have
not received enough attention from the research community to
understand them computationally. Several works focus on related

studies have reported adverse effects of inappropriate content in
music on the listeners [11].
We also measured the length of song lyrics as the number of
words in the song. Please refer to Figure 4a. Other songs have
shown a steady increase in length from 1965 to 2015. Popular songs
also showed similar trend till 1980. However, since then popular
songs are significantly more lengthy than other songs. Please refer to Figure 4b. This figure depicts the average duration of songs
per year measured in seconds. Both poplar and other songs rose
in duration till 1980. Since then, other songs have maintained the
average duration of about 240 seconds. In contrast, popular songs
were of longer duration from 1980 to 2010. However, the current
trend shows far reduced duration for popular songs. Please refer to
Figure 4c. This graph compares popular and other songs based on
speed. We measure the speed of a song as (length in words/duration
in seconds). We can observe that other songs have maintained an
average speed of around 0.6 words per second. However, popular
songs were comparatively slower till 1990 and since have become
significantly faster than other songs. Some studies have reported
that repetitive songs are lyrically processed more fluently and listeners prefer such songs [6]. We computed repetitiveness of a song
lyric as ((1- (number of unique lines/total number of lines))*100).
Please refer to Figure 5. Except for the period from 1990 to 2000,
popular songs are more repetitive than other songs.
Readability tests are standardized tests designed to provide a
measure indicating how difficult it is to read or understand a given
English text. We applied the well known Flesch Kincaid Readability

STYLE ANALYSIS

For style analysis, we created two datasets: Billboard (BB) and
Million Song Dataset (MSD). For both the datasets, we obtained
the song lyrics by scraping through the user-generated content on
multiple websites such as MetroLyrics (www.metrolyrics.com)and
LyricsMode (www.lyricsmode.com). The BB dataset contains top
100 songs for each year (1965 to 2015) from the Billboard Hot 100 list
(www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100). We consider these 5100 songs
as popular songs. The original million song dataset only provides
audio features and song metadata [3]. It does not provide song
lyrics. Out of all songs listed in the original million song dataset,
we could obtain lyrics only for 451,045 songs. We ensured that our
BB and MSD datasets had no songs in common. Thus total songs
in our analysis are around half a million. We had to do extensive
data cleaning and preprocessing to use the scraped lyrics.
We started with an analysis of the vocabulary of song lyrics.
Please refer to Figure 1. This figure shows word clouds of the top
100 words used in popular song lyrics for years 1965 and 2015. We
can observe that there is a major shift in vocabulary over time.
For example, in 1965 the most popular word was “love”. However,
it was no more the case in 2015. To better visualize such trends,
we have developed a word rank comparison tool2 . Given any set
of words, this tool plots the relative popularity of those words in
popular song lyrics through various years. Please refer to Figure 2.
This figure compares popularity of words “rock" and “blues" over
the period from 1965 to 2015. For a given year Y , lower value of
rank for a word W indicates more frequent use of that word W in
popular song lyrics of year Y . We can observe that word “rock" has
maintained its popularity as compared to word “blues".
We also looked at the usage of swear words. To compile the list of
swear words, we used various online resources. This list is available
along with our code. Please refer to Figure 3. This graph shows
a comparison between popular (BB) and other (MSD) song lyrics
based on swear word usage over the period from 1965 to 2015. We
can observe that other songs have steadily gained the swear word
usage over this period. From 1965 to 1995, popular songs used fewer
swear words as compared to the other songs. However, from the
1990s there is a persistent trend of increasing swear word usage in
popular songs. As compared to 1980s, swear words are used almost
ten times more frequently now in popular song lyrics. Multiple

Test (FK) on the song lyrics [12]. The FK test returns a number
that directly relates to the US Education grade system while also
indicating the number of years of education required to understand
the given English text. For example, an FK score of 5 indicates that
anybody educated up to 5th grade can read and understand the
given English text. Please refer to Figure 6. It can be seen that the
FK scores of popular songs have always been less than 2. Also, the
FK scores of other songs have always been quite higher than the
popular songs. This difference indicates that popular songs have
always been easier to understand as compared to other songs.

BIAS MEASUREMENT

We humans have certain biases in our thinking. For example, some
people can find flower names more pleasant and insect names more
unpleasant. These biases reflect in our various activities such as
politics, movies, and song lyrics as well. Implicit Association Test
(IAT) is a well-known test designed to measure such biases in human
beings [9]. This test involves two sets of attribute words and two sets
of target words. For example, consider two attribute word sets as
pleasant words (nice, beautiful) and unpleasant words (dirty, awful).
Also, consider two target word sets as flower names (rose, daffodil)
and insect names (gnat, cockroach). The null hypothesis is that
there should be little to no difference between the two sets of target
words when we measure their similarity with the attribute word sets.
The IAT test measures the unlikelihood of the null hypothesis by
evaluating the effect size. A positive value of the IAT test indicates
that people are biased to associate first attribute word set to the first
target word set (Bias: flowers are pleasant) and second attribute
word set with second target word set (Bias: insects are unpleasant).
A negative value of the effect size indicates the bias in the other
direction, that is flowers are unpleasant, and insects are pleasant.
Larger magnitude of effect size indicates a stronger bias. If the value
of effect size is closer to zero, then it indicates slight or no bias.
Caliskan et al. designed the Word Embedding Association Test
(WEAT) by tweaking the IAT test [5]. Similar to the IAT test, this
test can measure bias given the sets of attribute and target words.
However, the IAT test requires human subjects to compute the bias
value. On the other hand, the WEAT test can compute the bias value
using a large text repository, and it does not require human subjects.
The WEAT test represents attribute and target words as vectors
using distributed representation methods such as word2vec and
fastText [4, 16]. The WEAT test computes the similarity between
words using the cosine similarity. Caliskan et al. have performed
the bias measurement on a large internet crawl text corpus using
the WEAT test. They have shown that their results correlate with
the IAT tests conducted with human subjects.
We applied the WEAT test on our song lyrics dataset. Due to
the small size of popular songs dataset, we cannot apply the WEAT
test separately on popular songs lyrics. Please refer to Table 1.
Corresponding to eight rows of the table, we have measured eight
biases. We borrowed these attribute and target word sets from
Caliskan et al. [5]. First two columns (w2v and FT) correspond
to measurements on the song lyrics dataset with word2vec and

fastText as the word embedding methods respectively. Next column
(CA) is the measurements reported by Caliskan et al. on a large
internet crawl text corpus. The last column (IAT) is the original
values reported by Greenwald et al. using human subjects [9].
We can observe that for all eight tests, all four results columns
have values with the same sign (positive values). This indicates that
all four methods agree on the presence of the bias. However, they
differ in the magnitude of the bias. We can consider the IAT column
as the gold standard value because it is reported based on the human
subjects. For six out of eight tests, FT values are closer to IAT than
w2v values. This indicates superior performance of fastText over
word2vec method to generate a semantic representation of words.
For five tests out of eight, FT values are closer to IAT than CA
values. For test number 3, 8, and 6 CA values are closer to IAT
than FT. Test number 3 and 8 are based on various names. Our
song lyrics dataset does not contain enough instances of these
names. Therefore generated word vectors for these names are not
accurate. Similarly, test 6 involves science related terms, and song
lyrics dataset is deficient in such words. Our song lyrics dataset
comprises of roughly 50 million tokes. This dataset is too small as
compared to the dataset used by Caliskan et al. that contains over
840 billion tokes. Despite this huge difference in training data size,
song lyrics are pretty good at capturing the human biases.
Out of all tests, we can see that the effect size of both FT and CA
column is highest for test 4. This bias is about gender stereotypes
and career paths. This bias can be expressed as males are more
associated with career-oriented roles and females are more associated with family-oriented roles. This high effect value means that
there is greater bias in these target groups. Doering and Thébaud
have shown that gender bias does not only disadvantage women, it
could also disadvantage men [7]. Their findings showed that when
gender stereotypes get attached to a role, it biases the authority
that people attribute to the person who happens to work in that
position. In a way, these stereotypes harm us all. With the dramatic
growth in consumption of music [17], such biases can reinforce the
psychological status of these target groups [19]. Hence, it is crucial
to address these prevalent biases in songs lyrics.

by investigating music genre-specific style and biases.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

We have analyzed over half a million lyrics to understand the style

that popular songs have several distinguishing characteristics that
can be expressed in terms of the style of lyrics. Lyrics can capture
