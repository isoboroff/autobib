The abundance of user generated content on social networks provides the opportunity to build models that are able to accurately
and effectively extract, mine and predict users’ interests with the
hopes of enabling more effective user engagement, better quality
delivery of appropriate services and higher user satisfaction. While
traditional methods for building user profiles relied on AI-based
preference elicitation techniques that could have been considered to
be intrusive and undesirable by the users, more recent advances are
focused on a non-intrusive yet accurate way of determining users’
interests and preferences. In this tutorial, we cover five important
aspects related to the effective mining of user interests: (1) we introduce the information sources that are used for extracting user
interests, (2) various types of user interest profiles that have been
proposed in the literature, (3) techniques that have been adopted
or proposed for mining user interests, (4) the scalability and resource requirements of the state of the art methods, and finally (5)
the evaluation methodologies that are adopted in the literature for
validating the appropriateness of the mined user interest profiles.
We also introduce existing challenges, open research question and
exciting opportunities for further work.

INTRODUCTION

Mining user interests from user behavioral data is critical for applications such as online advertising. Based on user interests, service
providers such as advertisers, can significantly reduce service delivery costs by offering the most relevant products (e.g., ads) to their
customers. The challenge of accurately and efficiently identifying

user interests has been the subject of increasing attention in the
past several years. Early approaches were based on explicit input
from individuals about their own interests. To avoid the extra burden of manually filling in and maintaining interest profiles, most
methods in the past two decades have focused on the development
of techniques that can automatically and unobtrusively determine
users’ interests based on user behavioral data from data sources
such as browsing history, page visits, the links they click on, the
searches they perform and the topics they interact with [15].
With the emergence and growing popularity of social networks
such as blogging systems, wikis, social bookmarking, and microblogging services, many users are extensively engaged in at least some of
these applications to express their feelings and views about a wide
variety of social events/topics as they happen in real time by commenting, tagging, joining, sharing, liking, and publishing posts [21].
This has made social networks an exciting and unique source of
information about users’ interests. The development of techniques
that can automatically model users’ interests from online social
networks would be highly important and have the potential to
improve the quality of applications that work on a user modeling
basis, such as filtering Twitter streams, news recommendation [1]
and retweet prediction [13], among others.
In this tutorial, we comprehensively introduce different strategies proposed in the literature, including our own work [4, 10, 11,
26, 28–32], for mining user interests from social networks with
respect to the following five perspectives:

(1) Information Sources: The type of information sources used for
extracting user interests from within social networks such as
textual content (comments, #tags), social network structure, and
images [4, 27]. Additionally, we review external background
knowledge sources such as semantic web resources and knowledge graphs that have been incorporated by some researchers to
enhance the accuracy of user profiles [6, 29].
(2) Profile Types: Most of works in user interest mining from social
networks extract users’ explicit interests that are directly observable from user content [2, 22, 23, 30]. However, given the increasingly noticeable free-rider, some other techniques focus on passive users and extract their implicit interests by considering the
interaction patterns between users and topics [24, 27, 28]. There
is another line of work that is dedicated to predict users’ future
interests instead of modeling current interests of users [19, 29].
(3) Underlying Techniques: Previous methods have employed different techniques to build user profiles including neural embeddings [10, 16, 19], collaborative filtering [3, 5, 8, 18], topic
modeling [17, 18, 31], link prediction [7, 28, 31], regression [4,
14], graph-based methods [9, 30] and Semantic Web technologies [12, 20, 29]. We review the techniques that have been used

for identifying user interests and their different architectural
variations.
(4) Scalability and Resource Requirements: Scalability is fundamental to user interest mining to accommodate torrents of social
content. To this end, we provide a comprehensive overview of
the speed-accuracy (efficiency-accuracy) trade-off when building
user interest profiles for existing techniques of the literature [25].
(5) Evaluation Methodology: Intrinsic vs. extrinsic evaluations are
two main evaluation techniques, which have been widely adopted
in the literature. Intrinsic evaluation helps to assess the quality of
the constructed user interest profiles based on user studies [6, 20]
while extrinsic evaluations measure the quality of the user interest profiles by looking at its impact on the effectiveness of
other applications such as news recommendation and retweet
prediction [30, 31]. We review how each of these evaluation
methodologies have been used in the literature.

CONTENT OVERVIEW

This tutorial presents a comprehensive survey of user interest mining from online social networks and covers the following sections:
Background and Introduction to Theory of User Interest
Mining: The tutorial begins with a session about basics of user
interest mining and various online social networks. This includes
preliminaries, motivations, and highlights on research questions
to which user interest mining from online social networks would
provide an answer for. Then, we introduce different third-party
applications that can take advantage of user interest mining from
social network to improve the accuracy of their results.
Techniques and Methods in User Interest Mining from
Online Social Networks: Depending on the desirable type of user
interest profiles, i.e., explicit, implicit or future user interest profiles,
previous work have adopted different approaches for addressing the
problem. Within these three categories, we lay out the details and
provide a comparative analysis of existing methods in terms of their
representation power, flexibility, resource needs and scalability.
Evaluation Methodologies, Future Directions and Open
Challenges: In this session, we first elaborate on different resources and two main approaches used in the literature to evaluate
user interest profiles, namely intrinsic vs extrinsic evaluation techniques. Next, this session presents exciting open research questions
in the state-of-the-art for mining users’ interests from online social networks. Accurate information extraction from online social
networks poses unique challenges due to the special characteristics of them. Social posts are rather short, noisy and informal
and they often do not provide sufficient contextual information
for identifying their semantics. This tutorial presents the open issues that are important but have not been well addressed in recent
studies. We cover potential resources (e.g., Linked Open Data) and
techniques (e.g. Learning-to-Rank, deep learning architectures and
causal inference) that can be relevant for mining user interests.
