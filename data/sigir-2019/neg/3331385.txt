ABSTRACT
This tutorial synthesizes and presents research on web tables over
the past two decades. We organize the work into six main categories of information access tasks: (i) table extraction, (ii) table interpretation, (iii) table search, (iv) question answering on tables, (v)
knowledge base augmentation, and (vi) table completion. For each
category, we identify and introduce seminal approaches, present
relevant resources, and point out interdependencies among the
different tasks.

Motivation

Tables are a practical and useful tool in many application scenarios. Tables can be effectively utilized for collecting and organizing
information from multiple sources. With the help of additional operations, such as sorting, filtering, and joins, this information can
be turned into knowledge and, ultimately, can be used to support
decision-making. Thanks to their convenience and utility, a large
number of tables are being produced and are made available on
the Web. These tables represent a valuable resource and have been
a focus of research for over two decades now. In this tutorial, we
provide a systematic overview of this body of research.
Tables on the web, referred to as web tables henceforth, differ
from traditional tables (that is, tables in relational databases and
tables created in spreadsheet programs) in a number of ways. First,
web tables are embedded in webpages. There is a lot of contextual
information, such as the embedding page’s title and link structure,
the surrounding text, etc. that can be utilized. Second, web tables are
rather heterogeneous regarding their quality, organization, and content. For example, tables on the Web are often used for layout and
navigation purposes. Among the different table types, relational tables (also referred to as genuine tables) are of special interest. These

describe a set of entities (such as people, organizations, locations,
etc.) along with their attributes [8, 10, 13, 27]. Relational tables are
considered to be of high-quality, because of the relational knowledge contained in them. However, unlike from tables in relational
databases, these relationships are not made explicit in web tables;
uncovering them is one of the main research challenges. The uncovered semantics can be leveraged in various applications, including
table search, question answering, knowledge base augmentation,
and table completion. For each of these tasks we identify seminal
work, describe the key ideas behind the proposed approaches, discuss relevant resources, and point out interdependencies among
the different tasks.
The tutorial is organized into six session, half an hour each.

Table extraction. A vast number of tables can be found on the
Web, produced for various purposes and storing an abundance of information. These tables are available in heterogenous format, from
HTML tables embedded in webpages to files created by spreadsheet programs (e.g., Microsoft Excel). To conveniently utilize these
resources, tabular data should be extracted, classified, and stored
in a consistent format, resulting ultimately in a table corpus. This
process is referred to as table extraction. In this tutorial, we present
approaches for the table extraction task, organized around three
main types of tables: web tables [7, 8, 13], Wikipedia tables [5], and
spreadsheets [9].
Table Interpretation. Table interpretation encompasses methods that aim to make tabular data processable by machines. Specifically, it focuses on interpreting tables with the help of existing
knowledge bases. Bhagavatula et al. [5] identify three main tasks

aimed at uncovering table semantics: (i) column type identification [25], that is, associating a table column with the type of entities
or relations it contains, (ii) entity linking [5], which is the task of
identifying mentions of entities in cells and linking them to entries in a reference knowledge base, and (iii) relation extraction [25],
which is about associating a pair of columns in a table with the
relation that holds between their contents.
Table Search. Table search is the task of returning a ranked list
of tables in response to a query. It is an important task on its own and
is regarded as a fundamental step in many other table mining and
extraction tasks as well, like table integration or data completion.
Table search functionality is also available in commercial products;
e.g., Microsoft Power Query provides smart assistance features
based on table search. Depending on the type of the query, table
search may be classified as keyword query search [7, 32] and table
query search [1, 11]. We also introduce methods that generate tables
“on the fly” in response to keyword queries [33].
Question Answering on Tables. Tables are a rich source of
knowledge that can be utilized for answering natural language
questions. This problem has been investigated in two main flavors:
(i) where the table, which contains the answer to the input question,
is given beforehand [21], and (ii) where a collection of tables are to
be considered [24]. Question answering on tables is closely related
to work on natural language interfaces to databases, where the
idea is that users can issue natural language queries, instead of
using formal structured query languages (like SQL), for accessing
databases [2, 17, 18, 22]. Semantic parsing is the task of parsing natural language queries into a formal representation. Semantic parsing
is used for answering natural language questions, by generating
logical expressions that are executable on knowledge bases [3, 14].
Knowledge Base Augmentation. Knowledge base augmentation
leverages tabular data for exploring, constructing, and augmenting
knowledge bases. Knowledge bases need to be complete, correct,
and up-to-date. A precondition of extending knowledge bases using web tables is matching table content to entities, classes, and
attributes already existing in those knowledge bases. Specifically,
matching problems include table-to-class matching, row-to-instance
matching, and attribute-to-property matching [4, 12, 23].
Table Augmentation. Table augmentation refers to the task of
extending a seed table with more data. Specifically, we discuss
three tasks in this section: row extension [11, 26, 31], column extension [11, 16, 31], and data completion [28, 29, 31]. Row extension is
similar to the problems of concept expansion, also known as entity
set expansion, where a given set of seed entities is to be completed
with additional entities [6, 15, 19, 20]. One might envisage these
functionalities being offered by an intelligent agent that aims to
provide assistance for people working with tables [30].
