ABSTRACT

require non-trivial learning techniques to help preserve the hierarchical property of the data. Such techniques include neighborhood
constraints on finer objects that are associated with the same coarser
one [8, 15, 19], and manifold learning that fits tree structured data
in the non-linear embedding spaces [20, 28]. These HRE methods
offer competitive performance on relational inference tasks.
While existing MRE and HRE approaches typically consider relations as labeled or unlabeled directed edges between objects, in
real-world cases, such relations are often complex and containing
much richer information than just a simple label. Consider that
the employees in an engineering company not only just constitute
the supervision relations, but can also share side information from
email logs and project collaboration records. Such auxiliary information naturally provides edge attributes that imply the relations
of employees by reflecting their communication behaviors. Ideally,
the HRE model should capture both the hierarchical relations, and
the edge attributes that induce the plausibility of the relation facts.
We develop a novel HRE method that leverages both the structure information and edge attributes to learn better representations
of the edge-attributed relational hierarchies. Our method combines
two model components to learn on two facets of the data. A hyperbolic relational embedding model extends the relational embedding
techniques to a hyperbolic space that well suits the embedding of
hierarchical structures. On top of that, an edge attribute model seeks
to enhance the relational learning by aggregating edge attributes
to infer the confidence of each relation fact. We apply our model
to represent the Enron organizational hierarchies [16], where a
comprehensive set of edge-attributes are extracted from the emails
between Enron employees. Experimental results demonstrate that
our method learns better representations of the hierarchical data
when compared with a variety of MRE and HRE models, as evaluated on the challenging task of hierarchical relation prediction.

Relational embedding methods encode objects and their relations
as low-dimensional vectors. While achieving competitive performance on a variety of relational inference tasks, these methods fall
short of preserving the hierarchies that are often formed in existing
graph data, and ignore the rich edge attributes that describe the
relation facts. In this paper, we propose a novel embedding method
that simultaneously preserve the hierarchical property and the edge
information in the edge-attributed relational hierarchies. The proposed method preserves the hierarchical relations by leveraging the
non-linearity of hyperbolic vector translations, for which the edge
attributes are exploited to capture the importance of each relation
fact. Our experiment is conducted on the well-known Enron organizational chart, where the supervision relations between employees
of the Enron company are accompanied with email-based attributes.
We show that our method produces relational embeddings of higher
quality than state-of-the-art methods, and outperforms a variety of
strong baselines in reconstructing the organizational chart.

INTRODUCTION

Hierarchical relational data represents an important type of relational data that models multiple-level or tree-structured relations
among real-world objects. Different forms of such data, including
ontological taxonomies [10], geographic thesaurus [32], and organizational charts [16], are at the core of many application scenarios
for knowledge management and information retrieval [1].
In this paper, we pay attention to the embedding learning for
hierarchical data [8, 15, 19, 20]. Corresponding approaches typically
encode objects from the hierarchies in low-dimensional embedding
spaces, which are similar to those produced by multi-relational
embedding (MRE) approaches [3, 21]. While unlike regular MRE
methods that capture simple relations as vector operations between
object embeddings, the hierarchical relation embeddings (HRE)

RELATED WORK

Multi-relational embeddings. Extensive efforts have been put to
MREs. Given each relation fact (s, r , t) that models the relation r of
the source and target objects s and t, MRE methods seek to capture
the relation fact with a plausibility function fr (s, t). A recent survey [29] categorizes the majority of MRE methods into translational
methods and similarity-based methods. Translational methods follow a common assumption sr + r ≈ tr , where sr and tr are either
the original vectors of s and t [3], or the transformed vectors via a
transformation specific to r [8, 18, 30]. Translational methods perform well on characterizing unidirectional relations, and are more
robust against the sparsity of the structure [25]. Similarity-based
models are more suitable for characterizing dense structures. Representative methods adopt Hadamard multiplication [31], circular
correlation [21], and bilinear tensor factorization [22]. MRE methods have been used to predict missing relation facts in knowledge

structures, and have been leveraged to capture the binary proximity
of nodes on unlabeled networks with hierarchical substructures
[20, 28]. We extend HRE techniques into the hyperbolic space, so as
to support the relational inferences of objects that form hierarchies.
To support the parameterization and optimization of hyperbolic
embeddings in the same way of Euclidean ones, we adopt the
Poincaré ball model [20]. The Poincaré ball model aims at embedding a hyperbolic space inside a Euclidean unit hyper-ball. Specifically, it is defined as a Riemannian manifold P = (B n , дx ), for
which B n = {x ∈ Rn : ∥x∥ < 1} is an open space enclosed by an
n-dimensional hyper-sphere, and ∥·∥ denotes the Euclidean norm.

2

дx =
дe is a Riemannian metric tensor for the Poincaré
1− ∥x ∥ 2
ball model, where дe denotes the Euclidean metric tensor.
The distance between two vectors u and v on P is measured by:

graphs [7, 21], commonsense ontologies [8], co-purchase records
[14] and drug interaction data [27].
More recent works propose HRE methods for the characterization of hierarchical structures, where regular MRE methods fall
short. To better represent the hierarchies, some methods introduce
hierarchical neighborhood constraints in node-proximity-based
[15] or translational models [8, 19], which aims at embedding sibling objects (nodes) of a hierarchy closely in the Euclidean space.
Other works extend MRE methods into hyperbolic spaces, and
seek to use the non-linear hyperbolic distances to characterize the
nodes in hierarchies [20, 28]. While these techniques effectively
preserve the hierarchical properties, they do not incorporate the
edge attribute information, which is demonstrated to be significant
in improving representation learning of the relational hierarchies.
Embedding edge-attributed graphs. Fewer works have incorporated edge attributes into graph embeddings [5, 6, 9, 13, 26]. Goyal
et al. [13] propose the use of edge attribute proximities to enhance
the learning on node proximities in unlabeled graphs, and Shah et al.
[26] capture the distributions of attribute values to perform edgelevel anomaly detection. These methods are proposed for unlabeled
graph structures where unidirectional relations are not considered
for objects. Chen et al. [5, 6] incorporate various edge labels into
graph embeddings, and perform label propagation to address semisupervised relation inferences. Similarly, a probabilistic score is
captured and propagated across uncertain knowledge graph embeddings following pre-defined probabilistic soft logic rules [9]. While
these works incorporate side information of relations into MRE,
they are only able to capture either a simple label or a score for each
edge, and do not leverage comprehensive edge attributes that affect
the proximity and confidence of relation facts. Most importantly,
these works do not characterize hierarchical structures.

The above equation shows the locality property of the hyperbolic
distance. Given any two vectors u and v with a fixed Euclidean
distance d ′ = ||u−v||, their hyperbolic distance grows rapidly along
with their Euclidean norm. This demonstrates a desired property
for preserving relational hierarchies. That is to say, the root of a
hierarchy can be placed near the origin, where distances to nearby
nodes are relatively small. Meanwhile, the leaves can be placed
close to the external boundary of P, where the much larger distance
growth allows the distribution of many fine-grained objects.

3.1.2 Relational Embedding Techniques. To embed a triple (s, r, t)
in the structure, a cost function fr (s, t) is used to measure its plausibility. A lower cost indicates a more plausible triple. We adopt two
representative techniques in the defined hyperbolic space, i.e. translations (TransE [3]) and circular correlation (HolE [21]). The cost
functions are given as follows, where ⋆ : Rd × Rd → Rd denotes
Í
circular correlation defined as [a ⋆ b]k = di=0 ai b(k +i) mod d .

METHOD

We first provide the definition of edge-attributed hierarchies. We use
O and R to denote the sets of objects and relations respectively. The
data we seek to model is an edge-labeled graph G, where each edge
T = (s, r, t) ∈ G is a relation fact that marks a relation r between a
source object s and a target object t, such that r ∈ R and s, t ∈ O.
Boldfaced s, r, t denote the embedding vectors of corresponding
units. G forms hierarchies, such that each r is either a one-to-many
or a many-to-one relation. A function A : O × O → Rk assigns
attributes to object pairs, where k is the number of edge attributes.
Our method learns two model components on two facets of the
edge-attributed hierarchies respectively. (i) A relational embedding
model seeks to capture the relation facts from the hierarchical structure in the hyperbolic embedding space, and (ii) an edge attribute
model utilizes edge attributes to predict the confidence of relation
facts, which is used to refine the learning process of the relational
embedding model. We hereby describe these model components
and the learning objective in detail.

frTrans (s, t) = ||s + r − t||2
frHolE (s, t) = −(s ⋆ t) · r
Besides these two techniques, we have discovered that the Hadamardproduct-based technique [31] does not perform well on B. Other
techniques that introduce additional parameters, including relationspecific projections [8, 18], bilinear mapping [22] and neural approaches [11], are left as future work due to that they need nontrivial adaptation to gradient computation in the hyperbolic space.

3.2

Characterizing Edge Attributes

The edge attributes represent an alternative view of a relation between two objects. Naturally, we can assess the confidence of a
relation fact based on the associated edge attributes. Such confidence estimations are supported with a relation-specific function
ψr : Rk → [0, 1]. Our edge attribute model is defined as a set of
regressors, each represents a different ψr . The training process of a
regressor iterates on object pairs (s, t) in a subset of O × O. Given
attributes A(s, t) and a relation r , ψr is fitted with 1 if (s, r, t) ∈ G,
otherwise 0. The confidence scores given by ψr is then incorporated
to refine the learning process of relation facts as described below.

Relational Embedding Model

3.1.1 Hyperbolic Embeddings. A hyperbolic space is a non-Euclidean
space of negative curvature [17], where the distance between two
vectors grows rapidly with regard to their relative distances to the
origin. This property has been key to the embedding of hierarchical

The learning objective of our model is to minimize the following
marginal ranking loss,

where γ is a positive margin, fr is a triple cost functions defined in
Section 3.1.2, and (s ′, r, t ′ ) is a negative sampled triple generated
by randomly corrupting either s or t following previous methods
[21, 31]. Here, ψr serves as a weight over the triple cost function fr .
A higher confidence given by ψr magnifies the cost fr and lead to
higher gradient for the corresponding training case of triple. Hence,
the model is trained towards the goal, where a triple with higher
edge-attributed-based confidence is more likely to be measured
higher plausibility (i.e. lower fr ). β is a positive bias which controls
the contribution of ψr to fr . Note that the parameters of ψr are
fixed during the optimization of J .
Gradient conversion. We optimize the parameters using RSGD
[20]. Each epoch t of training updates the parameters by θ t +1 ←
θ t − η∇ P J (θ t ) , where η is the learning rate. ∇ P J (θ t ) is the Riemannian gradient on the Poincaré ball P, which is easily converted
from the Euclidean gradient ∇E by

Besides relation facts, the corpus also contains 127,083 unique
email messages among employees. We extract and aggregate 11
email-based attributes defined by Prabhakaran et al. [24] and Gilbert
[12] for each pair of employees in the hierarchies. Given two employees o 1 and o 2 , these attributes are described in Table 1.
These attributes are expected to reflect the supervision relations
of employees. Note that such attributes have been used to characterize the dominance relations between employees1 [23, 24]. However,
we find those attributes alone to be not effective in predicting the
supervision relation facts that describe the immediate supervisors.

• MRE methods: These include Euclidean MRE methods TransE [3],
DistMult [31], HolE [21], On2Vec [8] and RESCAL [22].
• MRE methods with edge attributes: These include two of
the above MRE methods incorporated with the edge attribute
model using our learning objective in Section 3.3.
• Hyperbolic embedding methods: These are formed by extending the above MRE methods in the Poincaré ball, without the
consideration of edge attributes.
• Degree centrality: A baseline method has been used to predict
the partial-order dominance of employees based on the degree
centrality of nodes [2]. To predict the immediate supervisor of
an employee, it retrieves the nodes in the ascending order of
degree centrality, starting from the one that has the degree that
is immediately larger than the node of that employee.

EXPERIMENT

In this section, we present the detailed experimental settings. We
focus on predicting the hierarchical relation facts in the Enron
corpus [16], and compare our model against various baselines.

4.1

Baselines and Model Configurations

We compare two variants of our models which employ the two
relation embedding techniques in Section 3.1.2 respectively. Besides,
we compare with the following four groups of baselines.

Dataset

Our experiment is based on the organization chart of core employees preprocessed by Prabhakaran et al. [24], which contains 4,796
relation facts of 3,187 objects (2,585 employees and 602 department
units). There are 1,503 relation facts regarding supervision of employees (an employee supervises another), while the rest constitutes
relation facts regarding management (an employ manages a unit)
and affiliation (a unit contains an employee). The supervising relations thereof, naturally form large hierarchical structures, of which
the prediction is key to the reconstruction of an incomplete organizational chart [2, 4, 12]. We randomly split-off 30% of supervision
relation facts, where 5% and 25% are for validation and test respectively. The rest of the structure is used for training. The goal of
the hierarchy reconstruction is to predict the correct immediate
supervisor in each split-off relation fact, considering that every
employee has one immediate supervisor in the organizational chart.
Note that, the employees in the split-off relation facts appear at
least once in the training set, hence there is no zero-shot test case.

We initialize the parameters of our model and those of the hyperbolic embedding baselines from the uniform distribution U(−0.001, 0.001),
and enforce the norm constraint defined in Section 3.3. The Euclidean embedding baselines employ their default initialization and
regularization process. We search the hyperparameters based on
the validation set, for which dimensionality k is searched among
{15, 25, 50, 75}, margin γ among {0.25, 0.5, 1.0}, and bias β among
1o

1 dominates o 2 , if o 1 has a higher position than o 2 in the report chain, while o 1 is
not necessarily immediate (nearest) supervisor of o 2 .

edge-attribute model significantly improves the prediction of relation facts by incorporating edge-attribute-based confidence into the
learning process. Our method has outperformed various baselines
on reconstructing the Enron organizational hierarchies.

training ψr , we preserve all records of email attributes for relation
facts in the train set as positive cases, and randomly sample the
same amount of negative cases for employee pairs that do not form
the supervision relation fact in the train set.

Results

We aggregate three metrics on the test cases, accuracy (Hits@1),
the proportion of correct answers ranked no larger than 5 (Hits@5),
and mean reciprocal ranks (MRR). The results by four groups of
baselines and two variants of our model are reported in Table 2.
The degree-centrality-based baseline, although promisingly predicts the partial-order dominance of employees [2], is however not
suitable for predicting the immediate supervision relations. Among
the Euclidean MRE techniques, TransE offers the best performance.
This is attributed to that the vanilla translational technique is more
robust against the sparsity of the structure in comparison to other
similarity-based techniques [25]. Considering that relational hierarchies are often sparse [1], this suggests the translation to be
a suitable MRE technique for HRE. By incorporating the edge attribute model, the edge-attribute-based confidence scores effectively
strengthen the characterization of relation facts. Correspondingly,
we observe a drastic improvement of 16.34% in Hits@1 and 0.131
in MRR by TransE+Attr over TransE. Meanwhile, the hyperbolic
TransE (Hyper-TransE) outperforms the Euclidean one by 30.77%
in Hits@1 and 0.178 in MRR. Eventually, our best model variant
Hyper-TransE+Attr obtains the best performance, which outperforms TransE and Hyper-TransE by 31.67% and 0.9% in Hits@1
respectively, and by 0.188 and 0.010 in MRR respectively.
Hence, by combining both hyperbolic embeddings and the edge
attribute model, our method is competent in modeling and reconstructing the edge-attributed hierarchies.

CONCLUSION

We propose an embedding method to capture edge-attributed relational hierarchies. Our method leverages two model components to
improve the learning on corresponding data. The hyperbolic relational embedding seeks to capture the hierarchical structures that
