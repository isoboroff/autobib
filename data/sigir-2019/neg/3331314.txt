ABSTRACT

been the subject of numerous studies, investigating the role of users’
emotions in their willingness to search, their search strategies and
search performance, as well as studying the affect of the search
process on the users’ emotions.
However, while considerable research has focused on the study of
searchers’ emotions, little attention has been devoted to examining
the emotional makeup of the web pages themselves that are served
to users by search engines or the emotion profile of the subset of
web pages that users then select for further examination. What
can be said in general about the emotional charge of search engine
result pages (SERPs) returned to users? For example, can we observe
a general trend whereby more emotional results are ranked at the
top of SERPs? What about the relationship between users’ click
behaviour and the emotional charge of clicked documents: can we
see evidence of users favouring more emotional results?
In this paper we take a first step to studying the emotion profile
of web search towards better understanding the role of emotions
in search and ultimately in human decisions informed through the
search. For our study, we make use of the query logs of the Bing
search engine; a sentiment and an emotion lexicon, and conduct a
preliminary analysis of the search results’ sentiment/emotion signatures across a number of segments: clicked vs not-clicked results,
results returned for controversial vs mundane topics, relevant vs
irrelevant results, etc. Our findings show that, in our sample data,
there is a difference in the emotion profile of search results returned
for mundane and controversial topics, the latter exhibiting more
emotions such as anger and annoyance. We also see that while
results at the top of the SERP use less emotive language, searchers
are drawn to click on results preferentially in ways that correlate
with expressed sentiment and emotion.

Emotions are an essential part of most human activities, including
decision-making. Emotions arise in response to information, e.g.,
presented in web pages, and are also expressed in the words used
to convey that information in the first place. In this paper, we study
the emotion profile of retrieved and clicked web search results
towards the goal of better understanding the role of emotions in
web search. Using click logs from a four-month period, up to the
end of January 2019, we examine the emotions associated with
search results and contrast them to the emotions of clicked results,
taking rank and relevance into account. Emotions are assigned to
web pages based on two lexicons: SentiWordNet (positive, negative
and objective sentiments) and EmoLexData (afraid, amused, angry,
annoyed, don’t care, happy, inspired, and sad emotions). We look
at the sentiment/emotion profiles of search results grouped around
a set of controversial and mundane topics and hypothesise that
users are more likely to click emotionally charged results than
emotionless results, both in general, and in particular when their
query relates to controversial topics.

INTRODUCTION

RELATED WORK

Emotions express what stimuli (including information) mean to us
and they influence our reaction to the stimuli [4]. As such, emotions
provide a primary response mechanism that can focus our attention
and impact our perception, thinking and decisions [8].
The sentiment, and more recently, the emotional content of
online texts such as news articles, blogs, social media posts or
user reviews have been of great interest for a range of applications including opinion mining for products, entities, or events,
e.g., elections. Typically, sentiment analysis methods aim to derive
the sentiment/emotion of previously unseen texts by exploiting
the use of words or texts with explicit affective labels [7]. Lexical
resources, such as SentiWordNet [1], organise labelled affective
words into taxonomies, enabling for sentiment analysis to be performed directly via lookups or indirectly by training classifiers [3].
Recently, approaches employing distributional representation and
Deep Learning for emotion detection in texts have also been proposed, see Zhang et al. [14] for a review. In our current work we

Following the seminal work of Kahneman and Tversky [6], many
psychologists argue that humans are often less driven by rational
thinking, logical reasoning and the consideration of statistics or
objective facts, and—as inherently emotional creatures—are more
likely to think and act by relying on emotions, at least unconsciously [12]. Indeed, emotions are known to play an integral part
of information search processes as they affect a searcher’s attention,
memory, performance, and judgments [8]. As a result, emotion has

• SentiWordNet [1] is a lexicon in which a triple of sentiment
values, positive (pos), negative (neg), and objective (obj), is
assigned to each set of synonymous words in WordNet. Each
value is in [0, 1] and the three values sum to 1. For example,
the adjective “perfect” has a score of pos=0.625, neg=0.125,
and obj=0.25. The lexicon contains about 200k words.
• EmoLexData is a lexicon built by Song et al. [11] that contains about 32k words, each annotated with a vector of eight
emotion values: afraid, amused, angry, annoyed, dont_care,
happy, inspired and sad. The lexicon was built based on 31k
news articles from rappler.com, where users visiting the site
provided the original emotion labels.

opt to use two open-source lexicons as a way of attaching sentiments/emotions to web pages to enable our analysis.
In the context of affective aspects in information seeking behaviour, since the early research of Kuhlthau et al. in the 1990s,
numerous user studies have shown that emotions affect users’ willingness to search, their search strategies and search performance,
and that users’ emotions are in turn affected by the search process,
the system’s performance, the user’s interest in the process and
documents, and other variables [8].
However, as far as we are aware, very little attention has been
focused on the emotional content of search results in web search and
its influence on users’ click behaviour. Lopatovska and Mokros [9]
measured the quality and intensity of users’ feelings by collecting
“willingness to pay” and “experienced utility” ratings for a handful
of retrieved documents. Greving and Sassenberg investigated how
threat influences web search and found that when under threat,
users’ attention is directed more to positive pages and more positive
information is acquired and retained [5]. Closest to our work is
that of Demartini and Siersdorfer [3], who extracted sentiments
from web pages and compared up to 50 results from 3 commercial
search engines on 14 controversial queries. They saw no significant
differences between the search engines, but noted differences in the
sentiments expressed in retrieved pages for different queries. They
also found a relation between rank and sentiment: results ranked
on top were, on average, more positive.

While such dictionary based approaches can suffer from low
recall, they usually attain high precision. We opt for this approach,
rather than alternative methods that involve training a classifier,
for its simplicity and ease of interpretation. In addition, as both
lexicons are much more extensive than other often-used lexicons,
e.g., LIWC or WordNet-Affect1 , we expected recall to be less of an
issue. Indeed, each of the lexicons on average matched 93–94% of
terms in our document representations. Unmatched words were
associated with the sentiment/emotion values of (pos=0, neg=0,
obj=1)/(dont_care=1 and 0 otherwise), respectively.
Given sentiment/emotion vectors for individual words, the sentiment/emotion of a search result is derived as the element-wise
average of its word vectors. The sentiment/emotion of words with
multiple part-of-speech roles are also averaged.

METHODS AND DATA

4

We study emotions expressed by the titles and snippets of search
results by analyzing Bing’s query logs from a four months period.

ANALYSIS AND RESULTS

We analyze the four months of log data for our selected topics
by comparing the emotion profile of the search results’ titles and
snippets, segmented by rank position, relevance, clicks and topic.

Data. We start by selecting a set of mundane and controversial
topics, and a handful of positive (’sanity-check’) topics that we
expect to be associated with positive emotional content: see Table 1.
The positive topics are only used for checking that the lexicon
approach is reasonable. The controversial topics are those used by
Demartini and Siersdorfer [3], expanded with more recent topics.
The mundane topics reflect less controversial, everyday or scholarly
concepts, expecting that these would elicit less expressed emotions
by web page authors. We deliberately pick topics based on intuition
and prior to any analysis to avoid a circular definition.
We extract user queries, SERPs and user clicks (up to rank 5;
results further down elicit much fewer clicks [2]) from a four-month
period, between 1st of October 2018 and 31st of January 2019, from
Bing’s query logs. We keep only queries that contain our topic
words. As a result, we obtain over 16 billion query-URL impressions
(88% of which relate to mundane, 9% to controversial and 3% to
positive topics) with over 1 billion clicked URLs.
For each query-URL pair, we also obtain a document representation, consisting of the title and the snippet that was returned to the
user on the SERP. Finally, we merge relevance labels for query-URL
pairs when available: converting the original judgments to binary
relevant or irrelevant labels.

Overall Emotion Profile. First we derive an overall emotion profile
by averaging the emotion vectors associated with all documents
across all observed SERPs in our log data. We can average two ways:
1) micro-averaging across all queries and SERPs would result in
an emotion profile that represents the “average experience” but
is dominated by the most popular, so-called head queries or 2)
we can first average emotions per topic and then macro-average
across topics. Rows 1 and 2 in Table 2 show the obtained overall
emotion profiles. The sentiment scores suggest that most of the
search results are objective or emotionless. However, based on the
finer-granularity emotion scores, we see that the happy emotion
dominates, followed by dont_care and inspired. The difference
between the micro and macro averages shows the impact of head
queries, such as “facebook” or “craigslist”, which appear to be more
neutral (higher dont_care emotion contribution). For the rest of
the analysis, we report only macro-averages and only over the
mundane and controversial topics, except for row 12.
Emotions across Rank Positions. To examine the relationship between emotion and rank positions, we segment our data by rank and
average the emotion vectors at each rank: see rows 3–7 in Table 2.
Both the sentiment and emotion vectors show that search results at
the top of the ranking are less emotional than those further down

Assigning emotion labels. To assign sentiments/emotions to the
search results, we follow a lexicon-based approach and make use
of the following two open-source lexicons:

the ranking. We observe significant correlations with rank for positive, negative, objective sentiments, annoyed, dont_care, and happy
emotions (ρ = 0.38, 0.28, −0.37, 0.20, −0.62, 0.44; all p ≪ 0.01), and
inspired (ρ = 0.16; p < 0.05). We believe this is a side-effect of
ranking decisions such as preferring official, authoritative sources.
Indeed, the reduced emotional charge of the top result, compared
with lower ranks, is even stronger for head queries, where top results tend to be emotionless navigational results. When limiting to
controversial topics, we observe no statistical differences between
ranks 1 and 2 (but still do between ranks 2 and 3). The effect seen
here is in contrast to the findings of Demartini and Siersdorfer
[3] where results ranked on top, on average, were more positive.
While our dataset also includes mundane topics, the trend of less
emotional results at top ranks still holds for our controversial topics
(significant correlations with rank for positive and objective sentiments (ρ = 0.31, −0.32; p < 0.01), dont_care and happy emotions
(ρ = −0.63, 0.33; p ≪ 0.01), and amused (ρ = −0.21; p < 0.05).

surface search results that are more emotionally charged than mundane topics. We find statistically significant differences in positive,
negative and objective sentiments, in afraid and annoyed (p < 0.05),
angry and dont_care emotions (p < 0.01) for controversial topics
compared with mundane topics. As expected, the positive topics’
emotion profile shows high levels of positive sentiment, but, interestingly, it is amused, not happy, that shows a significant increase
compared to mundane topics.
Relevant vs Irrelevant. So far we saw that although SERPs tend
to contain less emotional results at the top, users are more likely to
click emotionally charged results. Next, we investigate if relevant
and irrelevant results differ based on their emotion profile: if relevant results happen to be more emotional, this could explain—at
least some of—the observed click preferences. This analysis is based
on the subset of 5 million query-URL pairs with a relevance label in
our dataset. Rows 13–14 in Table 2 show no significant sentiment
differences between relevant and irrelevant results, with the exception of relevant results expressing higher inspired emotions than
irrelevant results.

Clicked vs Not-Clicked. Rows 8–9 in Table 2 contrast the emotion profiles of clicked vs not-clicked search results. We can see
a clear user preference for emotional results: clicked results are
significantly more positive and happy than not-clicked results. This
suggests that despite the search engine ranking emotionless results
higher up the ranking, users are more likely to click on emotional
results, especially those expressing happiness.

Propensity to Click. Next, we ask whether particular expressions
of sentiment or emotion encourage searchers to click on a snippet: that is, whether the probability of a click correlates with our
sentiment or emotion variables. To examine this, we take a 2%
sample of our result-level data, stratified by topic, rank, relevance,
and whether the result was clicked. (That is, for each combination
of these four variables, we take a 2% uniform sample.) This gives

Controversial vs Mundane Topics. Grouping by topic type, rows
10–12 of Table 2, confirms our expectations that controversial topics

side-effect of less emotional content near the top of the ranking, on
average. Surprisingly, the clicked results show the opposite pattern,
with clicked results having significantly higher positive sentiment
and happiness compared to not-clicked results. We also see that
controversial topics lead to statistically significantly more afraid,
angry, annoyed emotional results than mundane topics. Finally,
we find that the profile of relevant documents shows significantly
higher levels of inspired emotions than irrelevant documents.
We used regression to understand how click decisions are influenced by rank, relevance and sentiment. After controlling for
rank and relevance, we find that positive results are more likely to
be clicked, and this is particularly true for results that were also
judged relevant. This preference for emotionally-positive results
could be loosely related to White’s finding that positive (confirmatory) responses were favored for yes-no medical questions [13],
although in our case we are not limited to yes-no questions and
our notion of positive is based on sentiment. The preference for the
positive could also be related to work by Greving and Sassenberg
[5], who found that in a negative affective or motivational state,
attention is automatically allocated to positive information.
In future we could incorporate more lexicons or go beyond
lexicon-based approaches for emotion analysis, expand our initial
set of topics and consider general web search traffic, incorporate
the emotion profile of the web page itself, and explicitly consider
user intentions, e.g., users looking to be entertained [10]. This could
confirm patterns of behavior around emotion, and lead to the harder
questions of why users behave in these ways and how search systems should be designed to better serve user needs, given these
preferences or biases. For example, could or should search engines
help to make users aware of emotional biases?

329 million data points. We then model whether each result was
clicked using logistic regression.
Table 3 summarises the best-fit model incorporating rank, relevance, sentiment, and the interactions between relevance and
sentiment2 . The effects are given on a log-odds (logistic) scale, so
effects > 0 correspond to an increased probability of a click and
effects < 0 to a decreased probability. All effects are statistically
significant (p ≪ .001).
As previously observed [2], click rate decreases with rank due
to user biases, search engine effectiveness, and searchers reading
from top down (row 1). We also see, as expected, more clicks on
relevant documents than on those judged irrelevant (rows 2–3).
Rows 4–5 show the effect of sentiment on the probability that a
result will be clicked. A purely positive document title and snippet
would increase the (log) odds of a click by 6.64 points, even after
accounting for rank and relevance, while purely negative text would
reduce it by almost as much. It appears that searchers are drawn to
positive sentiment on a SERP.
We also see interactions between relevance and sentiment. Of
documents which are topically relevant, those which appear positive are much more likely to be clicked (19.48 points on top of
the 6.64 from the main effect) than those which appear negative
(−11.56 atop −5.43). In other words, for relevant results the effect
of sentiment is greatly exaggerated compared to irrelevant results.
A separate model (not shown here), with terms for rank, relevance, and emotion, demonstrated similar effects. Higher-ranked
and relevant results are more likely to be clicked (effect of rank
−1.16, relevance 1.87), as are results which seem happy (0.21), inspired (0.50), or angry (1.17). Results get fewer clicks if they seem
neutral (dont_care, −1.91), afraid (−1.03), or amused (−0.87).

CONCLUSIONS

This paper examines the emotion profile of web search for a variety
of mundane and controversial topics. For those topics, we analyzed
approximately 16 billion search impressions, assigning each of the
top-5 search results for each impression an emotional profile using
SentiWordNet, and a separate emotional profile using EmoLexData.
We identify a number of patterns in emotion profiles across
different segments of our data: Ranking criteria seem to have a
2 “Objective” of course strongly anticorrelates with the sum of “positive” and “negative”,

so we drop this from the model.
