ABSTRACT

management positions, eventually becoming an IBM
Distinguished Engineer. She has been serving in various senior
roles at leading academic research conferences in the field of
Web search and data mining, such as SIGIR, The Web
Conference (formerly WWW) and WSDM. She is a member of
the Technion Board of Governors and was inducted as an ACM
Fellow in 2013. Yoelle obtained her PhD in Computer Science
from the Technion, Israel in 1989, and holds an engineering
degree from the Ecole des Ponts et Chaussées, and a DEA
(graduate degree) in Computer Science/AI from Paris VI
university, both awarded in 1985.

In a previous keynote address [1], we have described how voiceenabled intelligent assistants are revolutionizing the way
humans interact with machines and how their ubiquitous
presence in homes, cars, offices are taking us closer to the old
dream of ambient computing. We also explained how Alexa,
Amazon’s intelligent assistant, is pioneering the domain of voice
shopping, considering the customer’s shopping journey in a
holistic manner.
In this talk, we will discuss in more details the key stages
required in addressing customer’s needs, namely (1)
understanding customers, (2) satisfying their needs, and (3)
predicting them. We will also provide a finer analysis of
customers’ needs, be they informational, transactional or
navigational needs [2]. We will conclude by presenting some
associated research challenges and encouraging the community
to explore the unchartered area of voice-enabled product
discovery.
