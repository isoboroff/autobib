ABSTRACT

1

Despite advances in the past few decades in studying what kind of
queries users input to search engines and how to suggest queries
for the users, the fundamental question of what makes human
cognition able to estimate goodness of query terms is largely unanswered. For example, a person searching information about “cats”
is able to choose query terms, such as “housecat”, “feline”, or “animal” and avoid terms like “similar”, “variety”, and “distinguish”.
We investigated the association between the specificity of terms
occurring in documents and human brain activity measured via
electroencephalography (EEG). We analyzed the brain activity data
of fifteen participants, recorded in response to reading terms from
Wikipedia documents. Term specificity was shown to be associated
with the amplitude of evoked brain responses. The results indicate that by being able to determine which terms carry maximal
information about, and can best discriminate between, documents,
people have the capability to enter good query terms. Moreover, our
results suggest that the effective query term selection process, often
observed in practical search behavior studies, has a neural basis.
We believe our findings constitute an important step in revealing
the cognitive processing behind query formulation and evaluating
informativeness of language in general.

Information retrieval systems have two primary components that
determine their performance: queries representing information
needs of users and the retrieval system computing the relevance and
presenting information in response to the queries. Consequently,
information retrieval research has mainly focused on improving the
retrieval methods and computational support for creating queries.
Behavioral evidence from laboratory and in-the-wild studies, on
the other hand, have shown that users write and select queries that
can be successfully used as input in search engines [19, 45, 46, 48].
Consequently, the user’s ability to select query terms has become
a commonly accepted assumption. But do we really know if this
assumption holds?
While observed search behavior shows that users write effective
queries [41, 44], and previous work shows that information needs
and relevance can be traced to brain activity [13, 14, 17, 32], the
underlying mechanism on why humans are able to select specific
terms in their queries remains uncharted. For example, the terms
“India”, “Asia”, or “Gandhi” are better at distinguishing the topic
“India” from other topics than the terms “is”, “vast”, or “hot”. But how
are we able to make this distinction between important and less
important terms? Previous work has shown behavioral evidence
that this happens in practice [3, 43, 44, 46], but does not provide us
with direct evidence of a neural origin of our ability to distinguish
specific from non-specific terms. Are queries simply learned by
trial-and-error when interacting with search engines, or are queries
something that have a neural origin – are they based on some
fundamental, cognitive functions that determine which terms are
specific enough for an information need and which terms are less
specific?
We set out to study whether term specificity is associated with
brain activity and which neural correlates are distinguishable for
specific and non-specific terms, as illustrated in Figure 1. More precisely, we define the following research question: Is the specificity
of a term associated with the amplitude of its evoked brain activity?
A study was conducted in which EEG was recorded while participants read documents. The event related potential evoked by each
word was analysed in order to measure the association between
electrophysiological features and the information that the word
carries in the document context.
The results show that term specificity is associated with amplified brain activity occurring between 200 to 800 ms following the
presentation of the term. This suggests that the human capability
to recognize terms that are specific for a particular document has

Figure 1: We show an association between term specificity and the amplitude of the evoked brain potentials measured via
Electroencephalography (EEG) in response to reading terms from Wikipedia documents. Specific terms, such as ’cat’, ’felids’,
or ’housecat’ in the document about cats are associated with significantly different brain activity than non-specific terms, such
as ’the’, ’often’, or ’distinguish’. © Tuukka Ruotsalo
a neural correlate. As participants had never seen the documents
before, their reading should not have been influenced by a prior
understanding of the document, or a particular search goal. Learning can therefore not account for the observed effects, suggesting a
natural origin that generalizes to new terms and documents.
The results imply that query-term selection has a neural basis
and that the human information processing system adjusts itself
online in response to terms that carry information in a document
context.

the first place. What are the cognitive processes that support query
construction?

2.2

Electroencephalography, the measurement of differences in electric
potentials recorded from the scalp, has proven remarkably useful
in the investigation of the temporal processing of external stimuli.
Only if a large cluster of neurons fire synchronously in a similar direction, will their summed postsynaptic potential be strong enough
to be measured from the scalp. The study of event-related potentials offers an elegant way around this conundrum: Knowledge
of the exact timing of stimuli allows one to time-lock EEG data,
so that by repeatedly presenting a similar stimulus, averaging the
activity will gradually cancel out all random, unrelated activity.
The event-related potential technique thus involves the analysis
of electrophysiological activity that is evoked by events that have
an onset defined to the millisecond. The temporal precision, in
other words, allows us to attribute scalp electric potentials to brain
activity.
The onset of differences between evoked responses are often seen
as diagnostic to the depth of processing: early (<100 ms) differences
tend to result from lower level differences in stimuli, such as in
spatial location [20], while later (>250 ms) differences commonly
involve more cognitive operations, such as context updating [10],
and semantic integration [25].
While the specificity of search queries itself has received little attention in cognitive science or psycholinguistics, the study
of event-related potential shows the remarkable degree to which
evoked brain activity involves preferential processing of distinct,
meaningful information. Indeed, two of the most studied eventrelated potentials in psychophysiology are the N2 and P3 families
[27]. The N2 is found ca. 200-400 ms after presentation of a stimulus
that deviates in some way from a repetitively occurring series of
stimuli, such as a high tone after low tones, or a red circle after
green circles [33]. If, additionally, such a stimulus is meaningful,
whether that is defined by it being novel, improbable, informative, or task-relevant [10, 38, 47], it will evoke a successive positive

BACKGROUND

Our work is related to various, conventionally distinct, research
areas: early information science work on term specificity and query
formulation, cognitive neuroscience and psycholinguistics, and
the utilization of neuroscience methods in information retrieval
research.

2.1

Cognitive neuroscience and
psycholinguistics

Term specificity and query formulation

The early research on information retrieval has already revealed the
importance of term specificity [21] and its relation to effectiveness
of weighting schemes [39, 43]. Researchers have proposed a variety
of measures for term specificity starting from the early work on
tf-idf [21] to generative query likelihood of language models [39].
In addition to specificity of terms in queries, researchers have
also studied the effect of the type of queries [46], query length [6],
and query composition process [3, 42, 45] with respect to retrieval
effectiveness. Methods and tools have been proposed to predict
query performance [8] and assist the user in the query construction
process [7, 24, 45]. However, in the end, the queries are only as
good as the searchers’ capability to formulate or recognize them.
Consequently, the human mental process of recalling or recognizing
the query terms that are specific for a particular document is crucial
in the search process.
Previous research on selecting query terms, issuing query phrases,
and studying their effectiveness is, however, based largely on behavioral evidence [3, 11, 41, 50]. That is, the studies have concentrated
on analysing query logs. Consequently, we have little to no evidence on how humans are able to come up with the query terms in

376

potential after ca. 300-700 ms, commonly called the P3. Together,
these potentials that are intimately associated with specificity and
informativeness therefore not only account for a significant part of
the literature on psychophysiology, but also for much of the evoked
brain response in general.
The study of psycholinguistics furthermore shows that semantically and syntactically distinct words evoke brain responses that
are indirectly related to term specificity. In particular, Kutas and
Hillyard [26] showed that unexpected deviants in a linguistic context will evoke a strong negativity 400 ms after the semantically
ill-fitting word. Numerous studies (see [25], for a review) have since
improved our understanding of the N400 component as a response
to a semantic integration process. In contrast to the semantic negativity of the N400, syntactic oddities were found to be associated
with a successive positivity at ca 600 ms, commonly called the P600
or syntactic positive shift [18]. Rather than involving syntactic
analysis, however, it has been suggested that the grammatic oddity
prompts an attempt to re-evaluate the preceding sentence in order
to comprehend it [22]. This suggests that P600 can be related to
deeper cognitive processing involved in comprehending text in
general.
The majority of previous research treat stimuli (words, sentences,
discourses etc.) as a manipulated variable, hand-crafted to produce
a certain effect in the brain via purposely caused anomalies. While
such an approach has provided valuable insights on the cognitive
processes associated with language processing, the results may not
generalise towards naturally occurring human language processing.
In contrast to studies based on experimentally manipulated syntax
and semantics, we investigate, to our knowledge for the first time,
the effect of term specificity for human cognitive processing in a
real-world document context.

2.3

Researchers have also aimed beyond studying when and where
brain activity can be detected and engineered methods and systems
that utilize neurophysiological measurements as input to search
engines. Physiological signals have the advantage of implicitly eliciting relevance signals by exposing more items and collect relevance
feedback without disrupting the user’s search process. For example,
Kauppi et al. [23] studied magnetoencephalographic signals alone
and in conjunction with gaze signals in order to provide relevance
feedback in an image retrieval task. Similarly, Eugster et al. [13]
decoded the EEG with the objective of providing relevance feedback in a text retrieval task. Another study [15] demonstrated how
the brain’s relevance response can be harnessed to improve image
searches in ambiguous search tasks.
Moreover, Eugster et al. [14] gave relevant feedback on words
according to information extracted from EEG signals. The loop
between brain and computer was closed by presenting new recommendations to the users according to the EEG-based feedback,
which resulted in a significant information gain for about 70% of the
participants of the study. That work constitutes, as far as we know,
the first proof-of-concept IR systems that have performed automatic
information filtering on the basis of brain activity alone. Similar
work was recently reported where closed-loop system included a
combination of gaze and EEG signals [49].
Related to information retrieval, mental processes and psychophysiological states measured from a combination of neural and peripheral sources have also been used to affectively annotate information
[2, 5, 29]. In such scenarios, affective states can provide important
context information for when or how to present information to
user, considering awareness, relevance, and other mental states.
These studies have been important in providing evidence on the
feasibility of including brain signal based relevance detection in
real systems as well as information need and relevance correlates
in the human neural system. However, the nuance of how neural
correlates are associated with more detailed attributes of queries or
documents, such as term specificity, have not, to our knowledge,
been previously reported.

Neuroscience methods in IR

Recent research has begun to examine information retrieval relevant research problems using methods of neuroscience. Researchers
have utilized techniques of brain imaging to reveal the brain activity related to the underlying neural activity of participants engaged
in tasks relevant to information retrieval context, such as detecting
relevance or information need.
Neurophysiological correlates of relevance have been studied
by Moshfeghi et al. [30] using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) revealing three brain regions in the frontal, parietal and
temporal cortex where brain activity differed between processing
relevant and non-relevant documents. Moshfeghi and colleagues
[31, 32] also reported an experiment revealing a distributed network of brain regions commonly associated with activities related
to information need and retrieval, and differing brain activity in
processing scenarios when participants knew the answer to a given
question and when they did not and needed to search. This study
showed that brain imaging techniques can provide us information
about human cognitive processing even before it is manifested in
information search activity. The temporal pattern of brain activity
related to relevance assessment phenomena has also been studied
[1, 13, 17]. In line with our results, studies consistently showed a
variation within the first 800 ms of a relevance assessment process
from the presentation of stimuli within the EEG signals.

2.4

Contributions

Our contributions can be summarized as follows:
(1) To our knowledge, this is the first study showing that detecting term specificity has a neural basis.
(2) Our results suggests that the linguistic processing in the
brain reflects the statistical measure of term specificity.
(3) We show that learning cannot sufficiently account for the
observed effects. The presented text was new to the participants and effects were evoked immediately upon reading
words.
(4) The results imply that term selection in query formulation
has a neural basis, which underlies our natural ability to generally select discriminative query terms across documents
and information needs.

TERM SPECIFICITY

Term specificity in information theory refers to the degree that
terms accurately and precisely describe the content they refer to.
We defined term specificity using Shannon entropy [52], which

377

Session 4B: Queries

SIGIR ’19, July 21–25, 2019, Paris, France

constitutes an analytical measure that can be used to derive the
algebraic as well as probabilistic interpretations of term specificity
as commonly used in IR literature.

3.1

terms with an estimated specificity in the 25th percentile were labelled as specific terms, and terms with estimated specificity greater
than the 25th percentile non-specific terms. This distinction was
made for visualization and validation purposes. The effects between
term specificity and brain potentials were further evaluated using
a statistical model with continuous variables. A histogram of the
occurrences of specificities can be seen in Figure 2. The theoretical
maximum entropy for the set of 30 documents is log2 (30) ≈ 3.401,
and it is reached when P(d |t) is uniform.

Defining term specificity

Let D = (dl , d 2 , ..., d N ) be a set of mutually exclusive documents
(events). Assume that for term (evidence) t, we can define a probability distribution Pi = (p1 , p2 , ..., p N ) as follows p, = P(d |t) for
ÍN
i = 1, 2, ..., N , such that pi ≥ 0 and i=0
pi = 1.
Now, we can define the term specificity for an individual term ti
in a document context d using Shannon entropy as follows:
Õ
H (d |ti ) = −
P(d |ti ) · log2 P(d |ti )

3.3

The split of specific and non-specific terms using the 25th percentile
of the entropy distribution was initially based on manual inspection
of the data and an experiment in which independent assessors
estimated the relevance of terms for documents. We asked three
assessors to label each term in the 30 document collection for their
relevance to the document in which the term appears.
The terms were labelled by the three assessors to be either relevant (specific) or irrelevant (non-specific). The annotating setting
was single-blind, so the assessors were unaware of the entropies
of the terms at the time of labelling. Approximately 25% of the
words were labelled relevant, so in order to match the class sizes
of the human annotated labels and specificity labels, the 25th percentile cutoff was found to be valid. The assessors annotations for
relevance and the specificity labels were found to be in substantial
agreement (Cohen’s κ = 0.612).

d

In this context, the Shannon entropy H (d |T ) can be interpreted as
a measure of the degree of information uncertainty based on what
we know about the document d evidence given as a set of terms T .
Similarly, we can also compare the informativeness of terms. Consider a finite set of terms forming the vocabulary of the document
collection, T = t 1 , t 2 , ..., th and suppose H (Pt j ) > H (Ptk )) for a pair
of terms t j , tk . One may conclude that the term t j is better than the
term tk , because t j produces a state of lower uncertainty measured
via entropy. Thus, the evaluation of a term based on the entropy
function essentially amounts to the measurement of specificity of
the term. Intuitively, the entropy also signifies the term’s ability to
distinguish documents from one another, as if H (d |ti ) approaches
the maximum, the distribution approaches uniformity.
Wong and Yao [52] have shown that commonly used term weighting schemes, such as tf-idf, can be derived from such definition.
However, as entropy is directly interpretable in terms of conditional
probabilities of terms and documents, we directly utilize entropy
as our term-specificity measure.

3.2

Term-specificity estimate validation

Data and term-specificity estimation

In order to estimate term specificity in a general case, a large document collection representing broad topical and lexical variety is
required.
We utilized the largest openly available encyclopedic document
collection: the Wikipedia. Document models of 30 documents, shown
in the left columns of Table 1, were generated to estimate the occurrences of terms in documents, as well as a corpus model consisting
of all of Wikipedia’s documents to estimate the occurrences of
terms in the entire collection. Prior to constructing these models
punctuation marks were removed from the text, and the words
were stemmed using the Porter stemming algorithm [40].
To avoid zero probabilities, a smoothed term likelihood model
was constructed based on the aforementioned document and collection models by using the linear interpolation model [53]. Formally,
a smoothed estimate for a term given a document was computed
as:
Pt (t |Md ) = (1 − λ)P(t |Md ) + λP(t |Mcor pus ).

the participants, with the dashed line marking the 25th percentile of the entropies.

METHODOLOGY

An empirical study was conducted to investigate natural brain responses associated with terms occurring in documents. Typically,
IR experiments are designed to measure the goodness of terms in
retrieving some target documents that are relevant for a task. However, in order to study whether humans naturally react differently to
specific than non-specific terms occurring in the target documents,
we designed an empirical study that inverted the typical research

The specificity estimate and the likelihood in our case was computed for each term separately so the term length is one and λ = 0.1
was chosen as the smoothing parameter. That λ value was chosen
as it has been shown to produce the best results on short text when
using likelihood models in information retrieval [53]. Finally, the

setting: the participants read natural language text from the target
documents sampled from the English Wikipedia document corpus that was used to compute the term specificity estimates. EEG
was then recorded in response to reading each individual term
occurrence from the documents. This ensured that the recorded
brain activity did not reflect previously acquired query formulation
skills, but solely the natural responses to terms occurring in the
documents.

read both sentences. First, they were asked to indicate the name of
one of the topics by typing it on the keyboard. Second, they were
presented with a recall task, in which one of the sentences (chosen
randomly from the two) was shown on the screen, with one of the
nouns or verbs substituted by question marks. To indicate successful
reading, participants were asked to fill out the missing word by
typing it in. They were then presented with feedback regarding their
performance on these two tasks in order to maintain concentration.
After this, the trial would be complete and the next two sentences would be shown following an intertrial interval of 1 s. Three
1 minute minimum breaks were provided to separate each quarter of
the experiment, and ample possibility for further self-timed breaks
was provided throughout. Completing the experiment took approximately 100 minutes, including instruction and psychophysiological
preparation.

Participants

Seventeen participants were recruited from Aalto University and
the University of Helsinki. They were screened for health (no neuropathological history), handedness (right-handed), and English
fluency (scoring high on the Cambridge English “Test your English - Adult Learners” online test1 . The data of two participants
were discarded due to technical issues. Of the fifteen remaining, 8
were female and 7 male, and their English fluency was assessed as
high (Mean = 23.53, SD = 1.23; maximum value is 25). They were
fully briefed as to the nature and purpose of the study prior to the
experiment. Furthermore, and in accordance with the Declaration
of Helsinki, they signed informed consents and were instructed
on their rights as participants, including the right to withdraw
from the experiment at any time without fear of negative consequences. They received two movie tickets as compensation for their
participation.

Apparatus and stimuli

Stimuli were words, presented in 18-point Lucida Console black
typeface. They were displayed against a light-grey (RGB 82%, 82%,
82%) screen background, in the centre of a 300 x 100 pixel pattern
mask. This mask showed a grid-like pattern, with a variable-width
brighter window in the middle in which the words appeared. Words
were each 1-15 characters in length, and punctuation was omitted
from presentation. The sentences were clearly demarcated by wordlike character repetitions of 4-9 numbers (e.g. 3333333) or other
non-alphabetic characters (&&&&&&). These were designed to deliver
similar low-level visual information as words, to avoid low-level
mismatch effects, without provoking linguistic processing.
The LCD display used to present stimuli was positioned at approximately 60 cm from the participants, running at a refresh rate
of 60 Hz, and a resolution of 1680 by 1050 pixels. Psychology Software Tools E-Prime Professional 2.0.10.353 stimulus presentation
software was used to optimise timing of display and EEG amplifier
trigger control. EEG was recorded from 32 Ag/AgCl electrodes, positioned on F7, F3, Fz, F4, F8, FT9, FC5, FC1, FC2, FC6, FT10, T7, C3,
Cz, C4, T8, TP9, CP5, CP1, CP2, CP6, TP10, P7, P3, Pz, P4, P8, O1, Oz,
and O2, using EasyCap elastic caps (EasyCap GmbH, Herrsching,
Germany). Hardware amplification, filtering and digitisation was
done via a QuickAmp USB (BrainProducts GmbH, Gilching, Germany) amplifier running at 2000 Hz. The electro-oculographam
was also recorded, using two pairs of bipolar electrodes, situated
1 cm lateral to the outer canthi of the left and right eye, and 2 cm
inferior and superior to the right pupil.

Task

During the study, participants read 16 documents, randomly drawn
from a pool of 30, while their EEG was measured. The thirty documents were drawn from the English Wikipedia (see left column
of Table 1). All participants completed eight reading tasks, each of
which consisted of reading two documents. Each document comprised six sentences (the first six sentences of the Wikipedia entry),
which were read, one word at a time, across six sentences in alternating document order. In other words, in the first trial, the first
sentence of the first document was read, followed by the first sentence of second document, in the second trial, the second sentence
of each document, and so on. Participants were instructed to passively read what was displayed to them, and not to engage in any
additional tasks or mental imagery.
Sentences were displayed on a computer screen, one word at a
time, against a black rectangle with a grid-like pattern designed to
minimise luminance differences between individual words. Following an initial warning signal (“Starting trial”), and a pattern-mask
drawn from numerals and other non-literal characters (e.g. @@@@
in Figure 3), the first word from the first sentence was shown. Each
single word was shown for 700 ms (SD = 0.3 ms), and replaced
the preceding one without intermittent flash. After the last word
of the first sentence, another pattern-mask was shown to indicate
the separation between the previous and next document. The reading pace (of ca 1.43 Hz) was based on pilot studies suggesting this
speed was fast enough for fluent reading, but not so fast as to cause
interference between EEG potentials.
Following each reading task, we presented two validation tasks
to ascertain that participants had not forgotten the topic, and had

4.4

Pilot experiments

Preliminary versions of the final experimental procedure and design
were piloted with four separate participants. In these experiments,
we tested and evaluated, for example, the stimulus duration and
the task. The data of these pilot experiments were not used in the
final analysis.

EEG preprocessing

Electrophysiological data recorded using EEG commonly contain
sources of noise related to eye blinks, head movements, power line
noise, and so on. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the EEG

word in a sequence.
recordings, the EEG data was preprocessed according to standard
procedures [28].
To remove low-frequency signal fluctuations and high-frequency
line noise the data were band-pass filtered at the frequency range
of 0.25 - 35 Hz with a Firwin1 filter. After this, the data were split
to epochs spanning -200 - 1000 ms relative to the onset of each
stimulus. Per-participant thresholds were computed to identify
bad channels and epochs. For the computation of these thresholds,
the epochs of the data were absolute baseline corrected using the
average of the whole epoch -200 - 1000 ms, and the following subset
of channels was picked: F3, Fz, F4, FC1, FC2, C3, Cz, C4, CP1, CP2, P3,
Pz, P4. This subset of channels was chosen, because these channels
reside near the top of the head, where less noise is present.
Using the aforementioned channels, a maximum absolute voltage
was calculated for each epoch for the time interval -200 to 700 ms.
The 80th percentile of the absolute max voltages was assigned as
the voltage threshold. The threshold values ranged from 25 to 67 µV
between participants. Epochs with an absolute maximum voltage
over the threshold were marked as bad. In other words, 20% of the
epochs with the highest absolute maximum values were deemed
bad.
To find bad channels, the absolute maximum voltage was computed separately for each channel and epoch. Channels with an
invalid epoch rate of over 20% of all epochs were marked as bad.
Epochs were marked invalid if their absolute maximum voltage
exceeded the voltage threshold or if their voltage variance was less
than 0.5 µV .
Finally, the following modifications were made to the final data
set, which at this point included all the channels and was not baseline corrected: the bad epochs were dropped, and the bad channels
were interpolated using spherical splines [36], and each epoch was
absolute baseline corrected using the pre-stimulus period -200 0 ms. After the preprocessing the average number of epochs per
participant was 1550.

with each other, and the documents displayed which vary between
participants. Independence of observations is an assumption in the
popular Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) models, and breaking this
assumption may lead to overconfidence of the test (high Type I
error rate). In order to avoid excessive Type I errors, Linear Mixed
Models (LMMs) were used for modelling the dependence of brain
activity and term specificity. These models allow for partial relaxation of the independence assumption by random effects. To avoid
resulting to Type I errors, the LMM models were designed using
the “keep it maximal”-principle presented by Barr et al. [4].
The mean voltage in the Pz channel was computed for each ERP
component (components and their time windows specified at the
beginning of the results section), and LMMs were fit for the data
corresponding to each of the components. In other words, the brain
activity was studied overall for the entire ERP as well as for the
following components separately: P200, P300, N400, and P600.
Formally, the model was specified as follows:
Ypi = (β 1 + P1p )X i + β 2Z i + P0p + Li + D i + β 0 + epi ,
and the Null model respectively as follows:
Ypi = P1p X i + β 2Z i + P0p + Li + D i + β 0 + epi .
Fixed effects in the models were term specificity (X i ) and document interest preference (Z i ), for term i. Their corresponding
slopes were β 1 and β 2 , respectively. The random intercepts were
the participant (P0p ∼ N (0, τ 2 ) for participant p), the length of a
term (Li ∼ N (0, χ 2 )), and the document from which the term was
from (D i ∼ N (0, ω 2 )). Additionally, the model had a random byparticipant slope for the effect of term specificity (P1p ∼ N (0, ϕ 2 )).
Finally, β 0 is the overall intercept and epi ∼ N (0, σ 2 ) represents the
general error term. The null model was the same as the alternative
hypothesis model, except that the fixed effect of term specificity
was omitted.
Document interest preference, as specified by the participant at
the beginning of each reading task, was included to control the participants’ potential experiment-independent pre-interest in one of
the topics. The word length was added because a significant inverse
correlation between term specificity and word lengths (Spearman’s
ρ -0.74, p < .0001) was observed. Although it is not clear whether
the effect of word length can be separated from that of specificity;
Longer words tend to carry more meaning than short words [37].

Statistical model

The experimental setup in the present study provides many factors
which make the observations non-independent. Examples of the
factors causing non-independencies are individual differences in observations between participants, the lengths of words that correlate

Figure 4: Term specificity is associated with amplified brain activity. Left: Grand average voltages for each ERP-component for
the specific and non-specific stimuli terms at the Pz channel. The term specificity neural correlates are significantly different
between 200ms to 800ms after the term has been presented. Right: Significant differences between the specific and non-specific
terms are found for P200, P300, and P600 components.
However, in the model we wanted to control for this effect as it
could have been possible that longer words could have caused
more cognitive processing independent from the term specificity.
By-participant random intercepts were included to control for the
participant-wise variance of the base-level of the brain responses.
Additionally, by-participant random slopes for the effect of term
specificity were included, to control for the possible individual variations in brain responses to term specificity. Visual inspection of
residual plots did not reveal obvious deviations from normality or
homoscedasticity.
The models were evaluated with likelihood ratio tests between
the alternative hypothesis and the null hypothesis model.

Our results are also intuitive. The ERPs are amplified for example on terms, such as nucleus, atomic, atom, and neutrons for the
document atom; democrat, student, clinton, and president for the
document bill clinton; and supply, coins, and currency for the document money. These terms are specific and match the intuition of
appropriated query terms for the corresponding topics. Conversely,
the ERPs are declined for example on terms, such as used, equal, address, into, nearly, consist, and of which are intuitively non-specific
and would not count for good query terms independently of the
target document or topic.

Figure 4 (right) displays the average voltages for ERP-components.
The ERP-components were defined with time-windows poststimuli: P200 [100, 250] ms, P300 [250, 350] ms, N400 [350, 500] ms,
and P600 [500, 800] ms. These time intervals were chosen based
on visual inspection of the ERPs and correspond to the P200, P300,
N400, and P600 components that have been previously shown to
be associated with language processing.

RESULTS

Three types of results are reported: the overall effect of term specificity on brain activity, the effect of term specificity on particular
ERP components, and terms exemplifying the terms with low and
high specificity.

5.1

Overall term specificity effect

Term specificity effect on ERP components

P200. The difference in voltages for terms in the specific and
non-specific classes was found to be significant in terms of the P200
component (d f = 8, χ 2 = 6.74, Bonferroni corrected p < .05). The
P200 component is affected by the physical features of the stimuli
[35], so the difference in the amplitudes for the two term specificity
classes may be explained by the effects that word length has on the
visual characteristics of the stimuli.

Term specificity was found to have a significant effect on brain
activity associated with reading (d f = 8, χ 2 = 12.22, Bonferroni
corrected p < .01).
The greatest difference between the two classes was found in
the Pz electrode, and it was therefore chosen for further inspection.
Figure 4 (left) displays the grand average voltages for specific and
non-specific terms at the Pz electrode. The averaged difference in
voltages between the two term classes for the 200-800 ms poststimulus time range is displayed as a scalp topography in the lower
right corner of the plot. The location of the Pz electrode is highlighted with a green circle in the scalp topography. Specific terms
are associated with a long-lasting positivity starting at roughly
250ms and lasting until 800ms.

P300. The difference in voltages for terms in the specific and
non-specific classes was found to be significant in terms of the P300
component (d f = 8, χ 2 = 6.71, Bonferroni corrected p < .05). The
P300 is sensitive to a person’s response to a stimuli, rather than its
physical attributes. More specifically, the P300 is thought to reflect
processes involved in stimulus evaluation or categorization.

Table 1: Random five terms sampled from the high specificity and low specificity classes for each document used in the experiment. The sampled terms illustrate that the brain activity is significantly amplified for terms that can be considered descriptive
and good query terms for the documents.

N400. The difference in voltages for terms in the specific and
non-specific classes was not found to be significant in terms of the
N400 component (d f = 8, χ 2 = 4.89, Bonferroni corrected p > .2).
While we did not observe a significant difference in the voltages
between the low and high term specificity classes, it is notable
that the difference between the two classes is visually present. The
difference, however, does not grow after the P300 component. Thus,
the N400 component seems to be unaffected by the term specificity.

the specificity of a term associated with the amplitude of its evoked
brain activity? Our results show that term specificity has a neural
basis and specificity of a term is associated with its evoked brain
activity. In particular, term specificity is associated with human
brain activity in ERP-components P200, P300, and P600, which we
show to differ significantly between specific and non-specific terms.

6.1

P600. The difference in voltages for terms in the specific and
non-specific classes was found to be significant in terms of the
P600 component (d f = 8, χ 2 = 21.757, Bonferroni corrected p <
.0001). P600 is a language-relevant ERP and is thought to be elicited
by various grammatical and syntactic processing tasks. On the
other hand, it has been suggested that P600 is associated with
the cognitive effort that it takes to interpret language. Our results
support the latter and specifically suggest that P600 is associated
with the amount of expected information carried by a term.

Empirical findings

The results suggest that cognitive processing of terms is associated
with term specificity, and that humans seem to have capability to
naturally recognize terms that are specific and discriminative to a
particular document.
While this ability may reflect a behavior that is learned as a
function of performing successful and unsuccessful searches – i.e.
a result from learning good terms for a particular information
need – one would have expected to observe cognitive equanimity.
Conversely, our experiments revealed amplified potentials at first
exposure already. This suggests that the ability is not learned, but
a natural function of human cognition.
The present study was based on natural reading rather than
experimentally constructed linguistic stimuli, and we therefore
cannot with certainty distinguish which potentials precisely are
associated with term specificity. However, significant effects with

CONCLUSIONS

We set out to study the association between term specificity and
human brain activity in a scenario involving real data from a large
document corpora. We asked the following research question: Is

word specificity and the P300 and P600 ERP-components are in
line with the context-updating theory [9] of the P300 and the P600as-P300 theory: Informative words within a sentence are likely
to impact the context, the representation of the text, more than
nonspecific terms. The observed correlation on the P200 component is more unexpected, as the early onset precludes the effect
from being explained by the word’s semantic content, as semantic
processing is commonly theorised to occur later [25]. We surmise
therefore that it may derive from physical differences related to
term specificity, for example due to specific words generally having
a longer word-length, which affects the P200 [35]. Alternatively, it
may also be a consequence of certain top-down processes related
to preceding context and expecation, affecting memory [12] and
attention [34]. Similarly, the P200 is sensitive to repetition suppression [16], a reduction in neural activity when a stimulus is repeated.
This could explain the lower amplitude of the P200 component for
non-specific terms, as they naturally occur more frequently across
documents.

6.2

work shows evidence that term selection process is based on fundamental cognitive abilities that determine which terms are specific
enough for an information need and which terms are less specific.
To our knowledge, this is the first study showing that adult
human ability to detect specific terms has neural origins. As participants had never seen the presented documents before, they
should not have been influenced by a prior understanding of the
documents, nor a particular search goal. Learning term specificity
specifically for these documents cannot therefore account for the
observed effects, suggesting a natural origin that generalizes to new
terms and documents.
The results have a fundamental implication for research in information science and retrieval: the assumption that adult people
can recognize and issue queries that are discriminative has neural
basis and this ability naturally generalizes to new documents and
information needs.

Limitations

The EEG preprocessing was conducted in accordance with data
preprocessing standards for BCI systems [51]. We also used natural
stimuli from a general encyclopedic source and constructed the
reading experiment to ensure that any intentionality in selecting
stimuli text or individual terms would not affect the experiment. Participants’ pre-existing knowledge may nevertheless have affected
the results. However, this is unlikely to account for the present
results, as topics were of a diverse nature.
Moreover, we chose to use linear mixed models to avoid statistical
methods the assumptions of which the data did not fulfil. However,
including all of the factors possibly affecting the results as random
effects in an LMM is infeasible for two reasons: not all of such
factors may be determined, and, on a more technical note, an LMM is
known to have convergence problems caused by the model running
out of degrees of freedom due to constraints imposed on the data
by fixed and random effects. For the aforementioned reasons, we
picked the factors that we deemed caused most of the variance in
the measurements as effects in the LMMs.
While the pre-processing, the recruitment of participants, the
source and language of stimuli text, and the decisions made in
statistical modelling were carefully defined, a possibility of bias
cannot be fully excluded. For example, all of the factors causing
non-independencies in the measurements could not be included
as random effects in the LMMs. This is mainly due to the fact that
when studying natural language, there is little control over the
stimuli presented to participants. Factors such as sentence length
or word context cannot be fully controlled without compromising
the natural document context assumption.

Implications for information retrieval

In essence, decisions on query formulation and term selection happen in the human brain, but so far, our understanding as to whether
the query formulation is simply learned by trial-and-error when
interacting with search engines, or whether it is independent of
previous searching experience on the topic, has been limited. Our
