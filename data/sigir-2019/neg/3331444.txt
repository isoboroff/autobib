ABSTRACT
In this talk, I survey a small, non-random sample of research projects
in information access carried out as part of the Thomson Reuters
family of companies over the course of a 10+-year period.
I analyse into how these projects are similar and different when
compared to academic research efforts and attempt a critical (and
personal, so certainly subjective) assessment of what academia can
do for industry, and what industry can do for research in terms of
R&D efforts. I will conclude with some advice for academic-industry
collaboration initiatives in several areas of vertical information services (legal, finance, pharma and regulatory/compliance) as well as
news.

Thomson Corporation as a Research Scientists. He helped set up
and run innovation and research groups in Switzerland and the UK.
He is also Royal Academy of Engineering Visiting Professor of
Data Analytics at the University of Sheffield and a Fellow of the
Royal Geographical Society.
He was the recipient of the first ACM SIGIR Doctoral Consortium
Award and twice winner of a Thomson Reuters “Inventor of the
Year” award for the best patent application.
His research interests include information retrieval, knowledge
management, natural language processing (in particular information extraction), geospatial information systems, applied machine
learning and methodology.
