ABSTRACT

Table 1: Examples from CNN posts in Twitter and Telegram.

With widespread use of mobile devices, instant messaging (IM)
services have recently attracted a great deal of attention by millions
of users. This has motivated news agencies to share their contents
via such platforms in addition to their websites and popular social
media. As a result, thousands of users nowadays follow the news
agencies through their verified channels in IM services. However,
user interactions with such platforms is relatively unstudied. In
this paper, we provide an initial study to analyze and predict news
popularity in an instant messaging service. To this aim, we focus
on Telegram, a popular IM service with 200 million monthly active
users. We explore the differences between news popularity analysis
in Telegram and typical social media, such as Twitter, and highlight
its unique characteristics. We perform our analysis on the data we
collected from four diverse news agencies. Following our analysis, we study the task of news popularity prediction in Telegram
and show that the performance of the prediction models can be
substantially improved by learning from the data of multiple news
agencies using multi-task learning. To foster research in this area,
we have made the collected data publicly available.

for news agencies to share their contents. Many popular news agencies, such as CNN, Reuters World, and BBC, are currently using
such platforms. In this paper, we focus on Telegram,1 which has
been one of the most growing and popular IM services in recent
years with 200 million monthly active users.2
On the other hand, predicting news popularity (sometimes referred to as user engagement) is a vital task for news agencies;
because they always prefer to attract more attention by their news
posts [5, 6, 9]. Thus, understanding the reasons behind news popularity and predicting popular news beforehand are of significance
for journalists and news agencies. Popularity has also played a key
role in news ranking and recommendation, e.g., see [8].
Due to the importance of news popularity prediction, there is a
line of research on this topic. Previous work predicted news popularity based on user interactions with the news websites [9] or
the social media posts [1]. However, we argue that the conclusions
made by previous work do not necessarily hold for IM services and
their models cannot be directly applied to such platforms. Some evidence for differentiating news popularity in Telegram from typical
social media services, e.g., Twitter, are listed below:

INTRODUCTION

Recent years have witnessed a rapid growth in the use of mobile
devices, enabling people to access various contexts via the Internet.
Widespread use of smartphones and emergence of instant messaging (IM) services, such as Telegram, WeChat, and WhatsApp, have
revolutionized online communication for millions of users, which
has recently motivated researchers to study various aspects of these
services, e.g. see [4].
In addition to one-to-one communication (i.e., private messaging), instant messaging services often provide one-to-many and
many-to-many communications. This provides an appropriate basis

• As reported in Table 1, the Obama-era news was among the most
popular tweets of CNN, while was less popular in the CNN’s
Telegram channel. The Baby Charlie Grad news was among the
most popular CNN posts in Telegram, however, it did not draw
attention in the CNN’s Twitter account.
• The news popularity distributions for four news agencies in
Telegram and Twitter for the same time period are depicted in

Figures 1 and 2. The plots demonstrate the significant differences
between the ways users interact with these two platforms.
• In typical social media services, such as Twitter and Facebook,
each user has a feed page to monitor all the activities in his/her
network. However, in IM services, users can only read messages
in individual groups or channels. This significantly affects the
visibility of the content.
• The social network of users at each timestamp is well defined in
typical social media platforms, which provides important signals
for news popularity detection. However, in IM services, the relations are defined based on group and channel memberships and
most importantly the one-to-one user communications, which
are not known to popularity detection algorithms.
These reasons highlight the importance of studying the task of
analysis and predicting news popularity in IM services. Therefore,
in this paper, we study news popularity for a diverse set of news
agencies: CNN (a US based agency), Press TV (a Middle East based
agency), Reuters World (an international agency), and BBC (a UK
based agency). These channels are among the most popular channels in Telegram. We further investigate the feasibility of predicting
popular news in the mentioned Telegram channels. To measure
the news popularity, we focus on the number of unique users that
viewed a message3 in Telegram. Note that by forwarding a message
in the Telegram network, the views are accumulated for the original
message. Therefore, higher views indicates higher engagements
and thus more popular contents. Our major contributions include:
• Performing the first study on news popularity detection in IM
services.
• Creating a collection of news posts in Telegram for multiple
agencies. Our data is publicly available for research purposes.4
• Proposing a model to utilize information from multiple news
agencies via multi-task learning. Our experiments show that
news popularity prediction models can substantially benefit from
transferring knowledge across agencies.

the number of comments for a news post as a measurement for
news popularity. In another study, Tsagkias et al. [10] explored news
comment space and used comparison of its log-normal and binomial
distribution models to predict comment volume as a measure of
popularity. Lerman and Hogg [6] predicted the number of votes
to each Digg post to measure popularity. This task is also related
to user engagement prediction. For example, Zamani et al. [12]
ranked tweets about movie ratings in terms of their engagements,
i.e., total number of retweets and favorites. Previous work studied
the popularity of posts in news websites or social media [7, 11].
However, in this work, we focus on instant messaging services. The
unique characteristics of these services are enumerated in Section 1.
Introducing Telegram. In this paper, we focus on Telegram, a
popular instant messaging service for mobile devices and desktop
computers. Users in Telegram can send text messages, media, files,
and stickers. Telegram has three types of communication protocols:
(1) one-to-one, (2) one-to-many, and (3) many-to-many.
Channels in Telegram, which are the focus of this work, are
similar to public broadcast media and have been used for sharing
textual content, advertisements, etc.
Each message in Telegram has an attribute “views”, which demonstrates the number of unique users that has viewed the message.
Note that forwarding a news post to other channels, groups, or
individuals results in increasing the number of views in the original
post. In other words, Telegram accumulates the number of views
for the original message.

BACKGROUND

In this section, we briefly review previous work on news popularity
prediction and further introduce Telegram and its features.

News Popularity. Predicting news popularity is important for
journalists and editors so that they can efficiently allocate resources
to support a better reading experience [5]. News popularity can
be defined in various ways. For example, Tsagkias et al. [9] took

DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS

We collected all the posts published by CNN, Press TV, Reuters
World, and BBC through the API provided by Telegram. We selected
these channels to study a diverse set of news agencies. In addition,
they are among the most popular news channels in Telegram. They
are all verified channels and publish their contents in English. In
our study, we consider the news published in a 7 month period,
from March 8, 2017 to October 8, 2017.

3 Throughout this paper, the terms “message” and “news post” as well as “channel” and
“news agency” are often used interchangeably.

Table 3: Channel- (top) and post-based (bottom) features.

Table 2 reports the statistics of the data for different news channels. Surprisingly, the average views per news post are not correlated with the number of subscribers. These differences might be
related to the type of news that is covered by each agency and the
cultural differences between their audiences.
Hashtags and mentions are non-separable part of a message in
IM services. As also explored by the studies on social media [1],
hashtags are effective features for a wide variety of text mining
tasks. In case of news popularity, hashtags can show the main
purpose of a news item. In addition to hashtags, one can mention a
Telegram user, group, or channel in a message. Table 2 reports the
average number of hashtags and mentions for each channel.
In Telegram, media, e.g., video, image, and hyperlink, can be
linked to a post. They can be useful in engaging the audiences.
A post hyperlink is likely the link to the full news article. This
information is also captured and can be potentially used in the
future for studying different tasks, e.g., news summarization.
The views distributions for all channels are plotted in Figure 1.
According to the plots, the views distribution significantly varies
across news agencies. To estimate news popularity distribution, we
perform a distribution hypothesis testing and examined 89 different
distributions implemented in Scikit-learn.5 We then chose the best
fit for each, which is mentioned in the last row of Table 2. This
suggests that news popularity identification varies across news
agencies and one cannot generalize the findings on one agency to
the others. Based on this observation, we claim that it is unlikely
to train an effective news popularity detection model on multiple
agencies by pooling all the data together, which is validated by
our experiments. This has motivated us to propose a multi-task
learning approach for this task.

Multi-Task Learning

Multi-task learning (MTL) [2] is an inductive transfer learning technique whose goal is to improve the generalization performance by
leveraging domain-specific signals from related tasks.
In this paper, we consider MTL CASO [3] as an effective multitask learning model that uses a convex relaxed alternative structured optimization (CASO) that decomposes the model of each task
into two components: task-specific and task-shared feature mappings. It has been shown that there is an equivalence relationship between CASO and clustered MTL (CMTL) which assumes that tasks
have group structure in which all tasks in each cluster are related to
each other. We use a linear model that optimizes a logistic loss function. Since the distribution of data in our problem is highly skewed,
as suggested by Zamani et al. [12], we assign higher weights to
the instances from the minority class. To do so, for each task i, an
instance weighting matrix Λi ∈ Rni ×1 is defined, whose elements
correspond to the weights of the training instances for the i th task.
(j) Í
(k )
The elements of Λ is computed as Λi j = (1/ni )/( nk i=1 1/ni ),

NEWS POPULARITY PREDICTION

In this section, we focus on predicting the popularity of news posts
for each news agency in Telegram. In more detail, we aim at predicting the top 5% and 25% popular posts for each channel. Therefore,
this can be viewed as an imbalanced binary classification task (especially for the first setting).
In this paper, we are particularly interested in improving the
performance of news popularity prediction by incorporating the
data from multiple news agencies. Although our data analysis in
Section 3 demonstrates significant differences across agencies, we
hypothesize that there exists useful information that can be transferred between them in order to improve the news popularity prediction performance. From the different views distributions across
news agencies (see Figure 1), it can be inferred that pooling the
data from all agencies (i.e., putting all the data together) to train
a prediction model is unlikely to be effective. The reason is that it
destroys the training data distribution. Our experiments also verify
this claim. Therefore, we propose to employ multi-task learning
for identifying popular news items, where each news agency is a
“task”. The goal is to learn generalized individual model per news
agency by transferring knowledge between them.
In the following subsections, we first introduce the multi-task
learning approach used in our experiments, and further list the
features extracted from each Telegram’s news post. We then review

(j)

where ni denotes the number of training instances in task i with
the same label as the j th instance. Therefore, the mentioned logistic
loss function is modified by weighting each training instance using
the above weighting scheme.

4.2

Features

Our features are listed in Table 3. The first part of the table includes channel-based features that only describe the channel’s
characteristics.6 The second part of the table lists the post-based
features that are those related to the particular news post.

4.3

Experimental Setup and Baselines

To have a fair and realistic evaluation, we split the data into the
training and test sets in a chronological order, i.e., the first six
months of the data is selected for training and the last month is
selected for testing. As mentioned earlier in this section, we aim
at predicting the top 5% and 25% popular news for each agency.

are useful for the models that are trained by the data from different channels.

the percentage, the more imbalanced the data, and thus the more
likely the model to bias towards the majority class.
The MTL method achieves the highest performance in most cases,
specially in terms of balanced accuracy (BA) and F1-measure which
are the proper metrics for evaluating imbalanced classification
problems. STL-All often performs poorly, due to the fact that the
views distribution varies across channels, and thus putting all the
training data together destroys the training data distribution for
all the channels. The relative improvements achieved by MTL are
higher, when the threshold is set to 5% which is the hardest setting.
The reason is that the training data from each channel only contains
a few positive training instances and thus multi-task learning helps
the model observe more positive instances from different channels.
Although both balanced accuracy (BA) and F1-measure are common metrics for imbalanced classification tasks, they do not agree
in some cases. For example, by increasing the threshold from 5%
to 25%, the balanced accuracy decreases for the Reuters channel,
however, the F1-measure increases. This shows that in these cases
the model cannot detect the popular news when the threshold is
too low (i.e., 5%), however, it can detect the majority of non-popular
news. This often happens in imbalanced settings.

Therefore, we first found the thresholds that satisfy these percentages for training and test sets and assigned a binary label to each
post (“popular” or “not popular”). We linearly normalize all features
based on their maximum and minimum values in the training set.
In addition to the mentioned linear multi-task learning model
(called MTL), we also consider two single-task learning models in
our experiments. (1) An SVM classifier7 trained in an in-domain
fashion, i.e., for predicting news popularity for each news agency,
the model is trained on the training data from the same agency.
This method is called STL. (2) An SVM classifier trained on all the
data from all the channels, called STL-All. Both of these models
also use a sample weighting technique, exactly the same as the one
used for MTL. The hyper-parameter c of the SVM classifiers was
selected using 5-fold cross-validation over the training data. We also
performed feature selection using randomized Lasso, however no
substantial improvement has been observed. We use scikit-learn8
for the single-task and MALSAR9 for the multi-task models.
Evaluation Metrics. We use five standard metrics to evaluate our
models for the news popularity prediction task: accuracy, balanced
accuracy (i.e., the average of accuracy for popular and non-popular
classes), precision, recall, and F1-measure. Precision, recall, and F1measure are calculated for the “popular” class. Note that since we
are tackling an imbalanced classification problem, balanced accuracy and F1-measure are the proper metrics for such scenarios [12].

CONCLUSIONS

This paper provided an initial study on news popularity analysis
and prediction in Telegram, a popular instant messaging service
with millions of users. We studied a wide range of news agencies:
CNN, Press TV, Reuters World, and BBC. Our analysis investigated
the differences between news popularity distribution across the
agencies, and suggested that although most previous work on predicting news popularity in news websites and social media only
focused on a single news agency, one cannot generalize the findings
to all agencies. We further extracted several features in order to
predict the top 5% and 25% popular news posts for each agency.
The experiments showed that the performance of news popularity
prediction can be improved by utilizing the data from multiple
agencies via multi-task learning.

Results and Discussion

Table 4 reports the results for predicting the top 5% and 25% popular

show that predicting the top 5% news items is harder than predicting
the top 25% most popular news posts. The reason is that the lower
