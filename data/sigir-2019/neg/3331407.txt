ABSTRACT

1

Synchronous collaborative search systems (SCSS) refer to systems
which support two or more users with similar information need to
search together simultaneously. Generally, SCSS provide a social
engine to enable users to communicate. However, when the number of users in the social engine is insufficient to collaborate on the
search task, the social engine will encounter the cold start problem
and can not perform collaborative search well. In this paper, we
present a novel Synchronous Collaborative Search System with a
Live Interactive Engine (SCSS-LIE). SCSS-LIE proposes to apply a
ring topology to add an intelligent auxiliary robot, Infobot, into
the social engine to support real-time interaction between users
and the search engine to address the cold start problem of the social
engine. The reading comprehension model BiDAF (Bi-Directional
Attention Flow) is employed in the Infobot in the process of interacting with the search engine to obtain answers to facilitate the
acquisition of information. SCSS-LIE can not only allow users with
similar information need to be grouped into one chat channel to
communicate, but also enable them to conduct real-time interaction with the search engine to improve search efficiency.

Web search is generally considered as a solitary activity; browsers
and search systems are designed to support single-user scenarios.
Whereas, studies of search strategies in knowledge workers [6]
point out that users often desire to collaborate on search tasks.
Collaborative search systems exploit collective intelligence to
enable users to combine their efforts in Information Retrieval (IR)
activities and share information resources collaboratively. Most of
the work at present in collaborative search systems refers to systems which support an asynchronous, passive, implicit form of collaboration between remote users. These systems are referred to as
Asynchronous Collaborative Search Systems (ACSS) in this paper.
However, users in these systems often do not know that they are
collaborating or do not know who to collaborate with. In essence,
the purpose of these systems is equivalent to the traditional information retrieval systems to provide individuals with effective
retrieval information.
Another collaborative search method is to perform collaborative search synchronously, that is, two or more users come together in a focused group to perform real-time collaborative search
to satisfy a shared information need. These systems are referred
to as Synchronous Collaborative Search Systems (SCSS) [2]. Recent attempts on collaborative search systems are CoZapce [5] and
SearchX [7]. However, most of these systems leverage collaborative search between small groups of users such as specific people, colleagues and friends rather than for a general-purpose web
search. SECC [1] adds a social engine to allow users to communicate through multiple chat channels. However, when there are not
enough people searching for similar queries, the number of people
in the chat channel is insufficient to conduct collaborative search,
which results in the cold start problem of the social engine.
To address the cold start problem of the social engine, we propose to employ a ring topology to add an intelligent auxiliary robot
Infobot into the social engine to support multiple rounds of interaction between the social engine and the search engine. When there
is only one user in the chat channel, the user can still accomplish
the search task by interacting with the search engine. Furthermore,
the BiDAF model [8] is implemented in the Infobot to get the answers to the users’ questions to obtain information quickly.

INTRODUCTION

MOTIVATION

In this section, we introduce our motivation of implementing the
ring topology with the Infobot from two perspectives: solving the
cold start problem of SCSS, leveraging the advantages of QA systems to obtain information quickly. We first illustrate the overall
differences of ACSS, SCSS and SCSS-LIE. Then we present the improvement of our demo based on the two perspectives.

query. The Infobot receives the query, retrieves it in the
search engine and gets the answer. Then it returns the answer to the social engine, forming the ring topology.
Table 1 shows the overall differences between ACSS, SCSS and
SCSS-LIE. ACSS share a single-center topology, which supports an
asynchronous, passive form of collaborative search between multiple users. Figure 1 (a) shows the single-center topology of ACSS.
SCSS improve the search activities from an individual to a group
process by providing a social engine to enable multiple users to
communicate to perform synchronous, positive collaborative search.
Figure 1 (b) shows this kind of multi-center topology. However,
when there are not enough people searching for similar queries,
or when there are some deviations in the grouping of users, the
social engine will face the cold start problem.
To address the issue, we propose to move from the multi-center
topology to a ring topology. Figure 1 (c) shows the ring topology
of SCSS-LIE. We add an intelligent robot Infobot into the social engine as the proxy of the search engine to support multiple rounds
of interaction between the social engine and the search engine.
Users can directly complete search tasks in this interactive engine,
which increases user experience and search efficiency.

Leveraging the advantages of QA systems
to obtain information quickly

QA (Question Answering) systems provide a user-friendly interface to navigate through knowledge and information, which makes
it easy for users to obtain information without having to read the
entire retrieved document. The Machine reading comprehension
(MRC) tasks require the machine to answer a question by reading
and comprehending the question and related documents. To better utilize the advantages of the QA system to access information
quickly, we plan to employ the method of MRC in the Infobot to get
answer directly. Traditional MRC tasks share a single-turn setting
of answering a single question without considering the context.
However, in our system, users usually seek answers via conversation. Thus, traditional MRC models are not suitable to be directly
applied in our system. Inspired by SDNet [9], we exploit the idea of
Conversational Question Answering (CQA) in the Infobot to comprehend the related documents and conversation history and get
answers to the search query.
The task of CQA can be illustrated as follows: given a passage C,
and conversation history utterances Q 1, A1, Q 2, A2, ..., Q k−1, Ak −1 ,
the task is to generate response Ak given the latest question Q k .
To incorporate conversation history into response generation, we
prepend the latest N rounds of utterances in the conversation history to the current question Q k . So the reformulate question is
Q k = {Q k −N ; Ak −N ; ..., Q k −1 ; Ak −1 ; Q k }. The updated question
and related documents retrieved by the Infobot are then put into
the traditional MRC model to obtain answers. In this paper, we
employ the BiDAF model as the MRC model.

FRAMEWORK AND IMPLEMENTATION

In this section, we demonstrate the framework of SCSS-LIE and its
implementation details.

3.1

Framework

As is shown in Figure 2, our system mainly consists of three engines, i.e., the search engine, the cluster engine and the interactive
engine. The search engine provides search functions, e.g., query
completion, query suggestion and webpage ranking based on an

SCSS-LIE is coded with Python 3.51 . The user interface is implemented with Vue.js2 . Vue.js is a widely used progressive framework for building user interface. The web server is supported by
Tornado3 , which has the property of asynchronous and non-blocking
I/O. Whoosh4 , a fast full-text indexing and searching library, is
utilized to develop the search engine. The Chinese word segmentation tool - jieba5 is implemented in the cluster engine to cut users’
queries into tokens and extract keywords to facilitate the grouping
of users. The interactive engine consists of two modules, namely
the social engine and the Infobot. WebSocket6 is implemented in
the social engine to store session data and enable users in the same
channel to communicate. In the implementation of the Infobot, we
cut the related documents, conversation history and query into tokens by jieba and encode each token into a fixed-length vector (300dim embedding). Then we choose two rounds of conversations as
conversation history (N =2) and concatenate them with the current
query. Then we use the bidirectional RNNs (BiLSTMs [4]) to integrate the conversation history into the current query. We take the
last vector output from the BiLSTM as the query fusion vector. The
query fusion vector and related document vector are then put into
the BiDAF model to conduct reasoning and obtain answers. The
DuReader dataset7 [3], which is a large-scale open-domain Chinese dataset for MRC, is utilized to train the BiDAF model.
In our demo, we crawl about 250,000 pieces of data from Toutiao8
to construct a search system and illustrate the feasibility of the proposed framework.

indexed corpus. The cluster engine groups multiple users dynamically according to the keywords of the queries they search. It compares the keywords of the current user’s query with the keywords
of the existing groups in the social engine. When most of the keywords of the query are the same as one of the groups, the user is
divided into the group. When users in the group change search
queries, the cluster engine can automatically collect users’ new
queries and regroup them according to the new queries. The interactive engine consists of two modules, i.e., the social engine and
the Infobot. The social engine provides multiple chat channels for
grouped users to communicate to exploit collaborative search. The
Infobot is added in our demo to facilitate the functions of interaction with the search engine.
Figure 3 shows the working process of the Infobot module. The
Infobot first collects conversation history of users in the same chat
channel. Then it finds out the current user’s query based on the order of utterances in the conversation history and some symbols
such as ’?’. Thirdly, it searches the query in the search engine and
returns relevant documents. Then the current query is fused with
the conversation history. The fused query and related documents
are then put into the BiDAF model to get the corresponding answer and return it to the interactive engine. This process is referred
to as a single-turn QA interaction between the interactive engine
and the search engine. The Infobot then performs multi-turn QA
interaction to accomplish the search task. Users in the interactive
engine can input the symbol word ’info’ to start the Infobot. Moreover, we design a switch for the Infobot to allow user to control the
startup state of the Infobot. The Infobot works when the number
of ’info’ that the user inputs is odd, and the Infobot does not work
when the number of ’info’ is even.
When a user inputs a query in the interactive engine, the cluster engine will automatically run in background to dynamically
group users with similar queries into the same group. Each group
will provide a chat channel to enable users in the group to communicate with each other. When one user in the group inputs ’info’,
the Infobot will work as illustrated above.

methods to further understand the user’s query and make grouping more effective. Secondly, the performance of the Infobot relies
on the capability of the reading comprehension model to understand natural language. It is necessary to design a more powerful
reading comprehension model to understand natural language better. Finally, we will increase user satisfaction experiments to better
test the performance of the Infobot and further optimize it through
better interfaces and algorithms.
Overall, we hope that SCSS-LIE will be a good start for the research on intelligent synchronous collaborative search systems.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

In this paper, we present a new intelligent search pattern for the
synchronous collaborative search system. We exploit a novel ring
topology to address the cold start problem of the social engine and
improve the efficiency of collaborative search. Furthermore, our
system provides users with a more intelligent interface to allow
users to perform multi-turn QA interaction with the search engine
to accomplish the search task and improve user satisfaction.
The current version of the demo is designed to verify our initial ideas, and there is still considerable room for further improvements. Firstly, we plan to employ more diverse grouping approach
in the cluster engine. We will exploit some semantic understanding
