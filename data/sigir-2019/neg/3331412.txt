this proposal aims to investigate two key Research Questions (RQ),
namely: RQ1 How can language representation benefit from QT?
and RQ2 How can the dynamics of language modeled with QT?
To the aim of answering the research questions, the doctoral
research program is organized with two work-packages (WPs):
WP1 Semantic Hilbert Space. A general Hilbert vector space will
be proposed to unify sememes, words, phrases, and documents,
which will be implemented by quantum probability (especially with
complex-valued representations [2]) driven NN approaches [3, 7, 9].
WP2 Content Dynamics Monitoring. The above Semantic Hilbert
Space will be extended in a higher dimension namely a tensor
space [10], in which one can interpret basic NN components in a
perspective of higher-dimension space. Such an extension may help
address the dynamic issues of language tasks e.g. by investigating
quantum state transformation.

ABSTRACT
This doctoral research project investigates using Quantum Theory
(QT) to represent language, especially in some dynamic scenarios,
e.g. when dealing with dynamic corpora or interactive tasks. The
author plans to propose a quantum state driven framework for
language problems and generalize it in a high-dimensional tensor space. Dynamics will be modeled by the formalism thereof of
quantum evolution governing the update of quantum states. The
author argues that this proposal will pave the way towards a new
paradigm which may provide some novel insights about how to
represent the language and its evolution in dynamic scenarios.

MOTIVATION

Representing, retrieving and matching information is one of the key
concerns of the Information Retrieval community. In real-world applications like dialogue systems and dynamic corpora, information
may involve time spans and evolve in a dynamic process. Current
state-of-art methods for representing, retrieving and matching tend
to empirically adopt neural network (NN) approaches. This proposal
argues that the NN solutions not only lack effective interpretation
[4] and well-defined formulation in neural IR, but they also are
limited regarding addressing the dynamic issues.
Inspired by the insights of Quantum IR [5, 6] and possible quantum phenomenon in language and IR [1, 8], this doctoral research
project resorts to QT to reformulate the information representing
and matching by means of mathematically-sound vector spaces.
Intuitively, a polysemous word can naturally be represented as a
superposed state while the documents can be considered as a mixed
system with many words, in which the interaction between words
may be implicitly encapsulated in an entangled connection like the
connection between particles.

EVALUATION

Regarding the effectiveness, it is expected to achieve performance
generally comparable with state-of-art models and outperform them
in some specific tasks. The author is also trying to evidence this
proposal in terms of interpretability. One of the secondary goals
may be to provide some insights into designing NN architectures,
e.g., quantitatively setting the hyper-parameters.
