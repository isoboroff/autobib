This can be argued with a more comprehensive understanding of
underlying similarity relationships such visualizations can give and
with the greater range of possible feedback modalities. In a spatial
visualization, for example, feedback could be given by correcting
datapoint positions, drawing lines as borders for desired clusters
or rating the desirability of similarity relationships between result
documents.
Following the above-mentioned considerations, the research
questions we intend to pursue are: (i) Which feedback modalities
enable users to express the desired similarity measure and how
can interactive visualizations support users to generate feedback
effectively? (ii) Which metric learning methodologies are applicable
to improve a similarity model using the feedback from the proposed
modalities? (iii) Can a visual exploratory search using the outcome
of (i) and (ii) demonstrate arguable benefits over classic searches
using result list presentations?

ABSTRACT
Visualization of inter-document similarities is widely used for the
exploration of document collections and interactive retrieval [1, 2].
However, similarity relationships between documents are multifaceted and measured distances by a given metric often do not match
the perceived similarity of human beings. Furthermore, the user’s
notion of similarity can drastically change with the exploration
objective or task at hand. Therefore, this research proposes to investigate online adjustments to the similarity model using feedback
generated during exploration or exploratory search. In this course,
rich visualizations and interactions will support users to give valuable feedback. Based on this, metric learning methodologies will be
applied to adjust a similarity model in order to improve the exploration experience. At the same time, trained models are considered
as valuable outcomes whose benefits for similarity-based tasks such
as query-by-example retrieval or classification will be tested.
The measurement of inter-document similarities has been extensively studied in the past. There are various distance metrics using
different representations such as weighted term vectors (e.g. TFIDF, BM25) [9], distributions from topic models [7] or distributed
representations from pre-trained language models [5].
Learning a metric can create improved similarity measures that
fit specific domain characteristics or the requirements of a task at
hand. Learning to rank has attracted much research towards this
matter in the IR community. Related works form, together with
other findings regarding metric learning, the groundwork for this
research. In total, highly diverse approaches can be found: linear
projections of term vectors [10]; pattern matching in sequences of
word embeddings using convolutional neural networks [8]; word
sequence learning using siamese recurrent neural networks [6]; to
name a few.
Approaches using online feedback are particularly relevant to
this research. There, collecting implicit feedback based on result
lists such as observing clicks [3] or dwell times [4] are common
feedback modalities. However, there is only little research on metric
learning using feedback from interactions with rich visualizations of
inter-document similarities such as proposed in [1]. We hypothesize
that users can generate more valuable feedback while interacting
with an explorable visualization than with a simple list of best hits.
