Matching is the key problem in both search and recommendation,
that is to measure the relevance of a document to a query or the
interest of a user on an item. Previously, machine learning methods have been exploited to address the problem, which learns a
matching function from labeled data, also referred to as “learning
to match” [21]. In recent years, deep learning has been successfully
applied to matching and significant progresses have been made.
Deep semantic matching models for search [25] and neural collaborative filtering models for recommendation [12] are becoming the
state-of-the-art technologies. The key to the success of the deep
learning approach is its strong ability in learning of representations
and generalization of matching patterns from raw data (e.g., queries,
documents, users, and items, particularly in their raw forms). In
this tutorial, we aim to give a comprehensive survey on recent
progress in deep learning for matching in search and recommendation. Our tutorial is unique in that we try to give a unified view
on search and recommendation. In this way, we expect researchers
from the two fields can get deep understanding and accurate insight
on the spaces, stimulate more ideas and discussions, and promote
developments of technologies.
The tutorial mainly consists of three parts. Firstly, we introduce
the general problem of matching, which is fundamental in both
search and recommendation. Secondly, we explain how traditional
machine learning techniques are utilized to address the matching
problem in search and recommendation. Lastly, we elaborate how
deep learning can be effectively used to solve the matching problems
in both tasks.

INTRODUCTION

The explosive growth of various information on the Web has resulted in information overload, which greatly hinders users to accurately and timely obtain information of interest. Search and recommendation are two major approaches to address the challenge,
which are two modes of information access: pull and push [8]. With
information pull, the search engine accepts a query submitted by
the user, and then returns relevant results to satisfy the user’s information need. On the other hand, with information push the
recommendation engine provides information that may be of interest to the user. The fundamental problem in both search and
recommendation is how to conduct matching between heterogenous objects, which are query and document in search, user and
item in recommendation, respectively.
The main technical difficulty in solving the matching problem
lies in the so-called semantic gap. In search, traditional approaches
perform query-document matching at the term level. However, a
high degree of matching at the term level does not necessarily
represent high relevance, and vice versa. For example, if the query
is “ny times” and the document only contains “New York Times”,
then the matching degree of the query and the document is low,
although they are relevant. Semantic gap is pervasive due to the
ambiguous and variable nature of human language, since the same
term can represent different meanings and the same meaning can
be represented by different terms. While in recommendation, the
problem of semantic gap is even severe, because the matching is
performed between user attributes and item attributes, and there
may not be any overlap between the features. For example, in the
collaborative filtering setting, users and items are represented as ID
features, and it is challenging to perform matching on superficial
features of users and items.
To address the problem, researchers in the areas of search and
recommendation have been taking similar approaches to perform
matching at the semantic level, referred to as semantic matching [9]. In search, people try to perform more query and document
understanding to represent the meanings of them (e.g, using topic
models) and conduct better matching between the enriched query
and document representations. Machine learning models have been
developed for semantic matching and significant progress has been
made, referred to as “learning to match” [21]. These methods conduct the matching through either mapping the query and document
into a new semantic space [31], or conducting translation between
the document and the query [2, 7]. In recommendation, people
try to represent the user and the item as real-value vectors that
encode rich semantics (e.g., semantically relevant objects should

for semantic matching can be generalized to solve the matching
problems between any two types of objects. As such, we believe the
developments of matching techniques for search and recommendation can not only benefit each other, but also facilitate a wide range
of other applications.

have large similarities), and then perform matching at the semantic
level [13, 17].
While these traditional approaches work well to some extent,
their performance can still be limited by the insufficient representation ability of the models and simple matching functions.
Inspired by the recent renaissance of deep neural networks in
computer vision and natural language processing, a number of deep
learning methods have been developed for addressing the matching problem in search and recommendation. They have shown
promising results and demonstrated great potentials for further improvements [5, 10, 14, 24]. Generally speaking, the success of deep
learning (DL) in semantic matching mainly comes from two aspects:
1) representation learning, and 2) matching function learning.

• For representation learning, DL methods can learn abstract representations for data objects (or features), specially tailored for
the matching task. For example, in search, Feedforward Neural
Networks (FNNs) have been used to learn representations for
queries and documents [16], and Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have also been
used, for taking the ordering information of words into consideration [15, 23, 27, 28]. Similarly in recommendation, FNNs like
Stacked Denoising Auto-Encoder (SDAE) have been used to enrich item representation learning from texts and images [34], and
RNNs have been used to learn representation for sessions [22]
and multimedia content [3].
• For matching function learning, DL methods utilize multi-level
neural networks as the ranking function, which can effectively
aggregate obscure low-level signals to the matching score. For
example, in search, CNNs and RNNs have been used as the
matching function to aggregate the term-level interaction signals [6, 15, 24, 29, 33]. Attention mechanism has also been used
for the purpose [26]. In recommendation, CNNs [11], FNNs like
Factorization Machine (FM) [10] and Multi-Layer Perceptron
(MLP) [4, 12], and attention networks [32] have been integrated
into the matching function to learn second-order and higherorder feature interactions. Several recent efforts have combined
embedding-based and tree-based models to learn the matching
function for recommendation [30, 35].

After briefly introducing the semantic matching problem, in Part I,
we will recapitulate traditional learning methods for query-document
matching in search and user-item matching in recommendation. In
Part II, we will introduce deep learning approaches to matching.
Specifically, we will first abstract a unified framework for deep
learning solutions for search and recommendation, namely, feature
representation learning and matching function learning. We then
review previous works based on the unified view. Lastly, we will
summarize the tutorial and discuss the future directions.
The tutorial materials to be supplied to the attendees include
Slides: tutorial slides will be made publicly available on the
lecturers’ personal homepages.
Bibliography: a list of references will cover all the work discussed in the tutorial and provide a good resource for further study.
The lecturers gave a tutorial entitled “semantic matching in
search” at WWW 2012 [20], WSDM 2012 [19], and SIGIR 2012 [18].
In those tutorials, the traditional machine learning approaches to
the semantic matching problem were introduced under the web
search scenario. This tutorial is completely new with rich content
of the recent technologies, including 1) the newly developed deep
learning methods for matching, and 2) the methods for matching
in recommendation.

In this tutorial, we focus on the matching perspective of search
and recommendation, aiming to deliver a systematic review on
conventional machine learning as well as deep learning methods
for addressing the problems. As pointed out by [1, 8], search (information retrieval) and recommendation (information filtering) are
the two sides of the same coin, having strong connections and similarities. By unifying the two tasks under the same view of matching
and comparably reviewing existing techniques, we can provide
more insights into solving the semantic matching problems. We
expect this tutorial to be useful for researchers and practitioners
working on both tasks, since the innovations and experiences derived from one task might be transferable to the other. This will
facilitate researchers from the search and recommendation communities having fruitful idea exchanges, promoting the technical
developments of both search and recommender systems.
In addition to search and recommendation, matching also plays
a central role in online advertising, question answering, image annotation, and drug design, and other applications. The solutions
