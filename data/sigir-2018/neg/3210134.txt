ABSTRACT

within their communities, has been seen as a more effective way to
build a brand in terms of audience reception and return on investment [9, 25, 32].
Instagram, which is a visual content sharing online social network (OSN), has become a focal point for influencer marketing.
With power users and micro-influencers publishing sponsored content companies need to rate these influencers and determine their
value[17, 18, 38]. Most of today’s scoring themes rely on graphbased algorithms of a known network graph. Such graphs are not
always available, and building them for Instagram users requires a
great deal of resources, e.g., crawling time and computing costs. A
possible solution would be to infer the underlying network structure using the user activity logs, as described by Barbieri et al.[7],
but even in the event a graph is constructed it would not necessarily
be of much use given that information decays exponentially along
the graph even under optimal passive information propagation,
which is not the case.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we described OSNs in greater detail as well as current influence measuring
schemes. We then present our annotations and formal description
of the problem of measuring and ranking influence in Section 3. The
dataset of Instagram users and their posts is described in Section 4,
followed by discussion on the extracted and aggregated features of
the testable data in Section 4.2. Following this, we present our testing methodology, baselines, regression models and experimental
results in Section 6. Finally, we discuss our conclusion and possible
future work in Section 7.

This paper focuses on the problem of scoring and ranking influential users of Instagram, a visual content sharing online social
network (OSN). Instagram is the second largest OSN in the world
with 700 million active Instagram accounts, 32% of all worldwide
Internet users1 . Among the millions of users, photos shared by
more influential users are viewed by more users than posts shared
by less influential counterparts. This raises the question of how to
identify those influential Instagram users.
In our work, we present and discuss the lack of relevant tools
and insufficient metrics for influence measurement, focusing on
a network oblivious approach and show that the graph-based approach used in other OSNs is a poor fit for Instagram. In our study,
we consider user statistics, some of which are more intuitive than
others, and several regression models to measure users’ influence.

INTRODUCTION

BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK

Online social media networks are often described as a directed
graph with entities such as users acting as nodes and relationships
as the edges. Such edges can be unidirectional or bi-directional, e.g.,
an Instagram "follower" and a Facebook "friendship", respectively.
These edges do not need to represent a long-lasting relationship;
they can signal a one-time engagement, e.g., a "like" or a "comment".
Following this, link prediction in OSNs became an active research
field focused on community detection, in the case of users as nodes
[13, 27], or content suggestion otherwise [3, 37, 39].
In most OSNs, user-generated content is “pushed", i.e., propagated via interaction. When a user uploads a post, their followers
can see the post and choose to pass it along, creating a pyramidformed cascade of information. Thus, if user A follows user B who,
in turn, follows user C, and user C posts some content user B
chooses to share, user A is passively influenced by user C. These
social micro-networks tend to grow around influential, active users
[20, 33]. Instagram content, however, is “pulled", i.e., information
propagation requires activity along the pyramid, such that, using

The transition to Web 2.0 transformed the business models of online
marketing from a global ad approach based to individual opinions
and targeted campaigns [2, 23, 35, 40]. Web 2.0 not only took traditional marketing strategies to the extreme via viral marketing
campaigns [31, 36, 43], but it also gave rise to new techniques of
brand building and audience targeting via influencer marketing
[12, 44]. In fact, the use of micro-influencers, trusted individuals

our earlier example, for user C’s post to reach user A, user A must
look for content suggested by trusted users.
This situation raises the question of how to rank users in OSNs.
As OSNs are traditionally described as graphs, ranking has been
done using various graph statistics, from simple in/out degree to
node closeness [15, 16], as is the case with the work of Anger and
Kittl in Twitter [4] and Agarwal et al. in the context of influential blogs [1]. Other techniques extend to existing link analysis
algorithms - the most popular one being PageRank [8, 11]. Weng
et al. suggested twitterRank [42] and Khrabrov et al. introduced
starRank [30], both extensions of PageRank working on Twitter’s
follower and engagements graphs, respectively. On LinkedIn, a
professional OSN, Budalakoti and Bekkerman suggested a fair-bets
model for ranking via transfer of authority [14], and on Instagram
Egger suggested a PageRank extension for influencer ranking [19].

A total of 940, 439 posts by 115, 044 Instagrammers was collected4 .

4.1

The distribution for log average views per Instagrammer is presented in Figure 1a, from which we can tell that this statistic behaves
in a log-normal distribution with a mean of 748 views. Furthermore,
as this distribution is so close to normal, we ascertain that our selection of sampled Instagrammers is a good semblance of real-world
influence with micro-influencers populating the dense mean and
casual users and celebrities appearing at the distribution extremes.
Post views per followers and per engagement appear in Figures 1b and 1c, respectively; these show some underline truths of
Instagram. It can be seen that normally, the number of followers a
user has outnumber his views, as we expect following the described
flow of information. However, we found that this is not the case
for sponsored posts, massively engaged content or externally referenced content. Another unlikely situation is of posts having more
engagements than views. This relates either to bought engagements,
often via automation tools and fake accounts, or to an interesting
phenomenon on Instagram known as "Like You, Like Me" where
content is engaged simply to reciprocate prior engagements. The
issue mitigates as the number of engagements increase.
To avoid these sorts of odd behaviors, we performed univariate
outliers removal, ignoring the top and bottom posts for users with
posts statistics above 2 standard deviations.

PROBLEM FORMULATION

The influence of a user in an OSN has been described either in
simple, intuitive measures or as a non-intuitive measurable graph
statistic with no real-world meaning [19, 24, 42]. One such measure
is the user’s expected post engagements. We extend this definition
in the realization that being exposed to specific content often does
not lead to active engagement.
We say the influence of an Instagram user (Instagrammer) is the
expected exposure their content would receives, or, their expected
number of views per post. Adhering to the law of large numbers,
we can estimate the users’ influence using Definition 3.1:
Definition 3.1. Let U be the set of all Instagrammers, C be all
content posted on Instagram, vc the number of Instagrammers that
saw post c ∈ C and Cu ⊂ C is the content posted by u ∈ U . We say
that the influence of Instagrammer u is:

c ∈ Cu vc
In fu =

Instagram Statistics

Features Collected

For the purpose of this work, we collected basic features directly
from Instagram. Expanding on the posts features mentioned above,
we also collected user specific statistics. We then considered each
user as a data point with the following statistics:
likes The average number of user post likes.
comments The average number of comments per user post.
f ollowers The users audience size.
p
likes · f ollowers Geometric mean of likes and followers, taken
as neither statistic is an exact representation of influence.

comment s Another odd behavior indicator as bought engagel ikes
ments tend to effect likes more than comments.
f ocus The difference and ratio between most and least engaged
post, these features were designed to test the variance and
stability of a user engagement level.

INSTAGRAM DATASET

For the purpose of this study, a set of Instagram data was prepared
in April 2017, including posts published during 2015-2016 but prior
to September 2016. We focused on a subset of Instagram posts where
view counts were accessible. Independent studies have shown that
50% of engagements of an Instagram post happen within 72 minutes
of publication and 95% within the following week2 . As the change
of feed ranking in March 2016 did not cause statistically significant
changes to activity, and as all posts examined by us were over 6
months old, we say that the data is stable, meaning, all posts have
reached at least 95% of their potential views and engagements. The
data was prepared as follows:
(1) We gathered information on videos 3 published by a set of
randomly selected Instagrammers with publicly accessible
profiles. Denote the set of users as U . Each of these Instagrammers must have published a minimum of 10 video posts
before September 2016.
(2) For each video c ∈ C, we collected the following metrics:

REGRESSION MODELS

We attempt to measure influence using well known regression models via the features described at Section 4.2. Furthermore, as some
models are sensitive to redundant features, we perform recursive
feature elimination, generating a subset of informative features for
the problem at hand.

used Instagram API to collect user statistics. We did not use the API to gather
data for the posts themselves due to API limits. Instead, we parsed each post web-page.

The models tested include:
Ridge Regression(RR) An extension of Linear Regression,
RR attempts to overcome Linear Regressions’ problem with
feature multi-collinearity adding l2 norm regularization of
the coefficients to the minimization problem[26].
Random Forest(RF) Non-linear algorithms that rely on ensembles of decision trees with randomness injected into the
model in both features and instances selection[10].

6.3

We also introduce a meta-algorithm expansion of our own. It is
clear that not all influencers should be handled in the same manner
and celebrities statistics would show vast differences than those
of micro-influencers. We propose a Multiple-Regression model,
where data is separated to subsets, in our case, using the K-Means
clustering algorithm on the followers statistic [22], and building a
regression model for each subset.
Finally, it can be seen in Figures 1b and 1c that the likes and
followers’ statistics grow in an exponential manner. To handle potential bias towards these features, both in clustering and regression,
we transform these statistics using a log scale, i.e., f (x) = lnxx .

Comparison of Techniques

The results of the R 2 and r s statistics for the regression models
and baselines are provided in Table 1. These results include both
clustered and unclustered attempts, as well as, show the result of
the feature reduced models.
It is clear that the followers statistic, while intuitive and is often
used in real-world scenarios, is the weakest on any given metric.
This correlates with previous findings by Cha et al.[15]. The engagement baseline is the best choice for a direct ranking approach
as it is almost the best, certainly within error range, and is much
simpler to use than the full regression models.
Amongst our suggested models, Multi-Regression was not a
useful approach while feature reduction still resulted in strong
models with only half the features. When comparing RR and RF,
we clearly see that RR is a more accurate model. This is due to
a limitation of the RF model - while RR can return any possible
value, RF models can return only linear combination of values in the
training set and while this result in a better ranker, the predicted
value more often overshoots.
Due to resource and time constraints we ran the PageRank algorithm a subset of 10% of the users, resulting in an r s score of
0.673. These results, only better then the followers baseline, are to
be expected given Instagram’s flow of information, as discussed in
Section 2.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

In this section, we present the methodology for evaluating different
techniques and introduce two simple yet commonly used baselines.
We test our models and present the results of our attempt to measure
the influence of Instagram users.

6.1

Baselines

Two natural baselines for measuring influence are to use the user’s
audience size (followers) or engagement level (number of likes). We
use both statistics baselines, utilizing a Linear Regression model.
While outside our scope, for completeness purposes, we used the
PageRank extension suggested by Egger [19]. For this, we crawled
Instagram, creating a commentators graph around our test users.

Methodology

To compare between different models, we employ two commonly
used statistics. To test the model’s ability to measure influence,
we employ the coefficient of determination, denoted R 2 . Bound
by 1, higher R 2 scores would indicate lower error variance which
indicates a tighter model. Comparing the order of the predicted
influence with the real influence allows us to rank users. To test
the resulting ranking created we use Spearman’s rank correlation
coefficient, denoted r s .
To avoid the problems of a model tuned specifically to the test
data, we use a five-fold cross validation technique. We randomly
split U into five equally sized sets of disjoint Instagrammers and use
them as five train-test datasets, each test set contains roughly 20%
the size of the original set of users U and the train set is made of
the remaining 80%. The results are averaged on the five test cases.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

This work focused on measuring influence and influencer ranking
on Instagram, a content sharing OSN. Our definition of influence
(Def. 3.1) and the features extracted from public information allowed
us to use out-of-the-box regression models to create what is, to
our knowledge, the first influence ranking algorithm based on an
intuitive score derived from network-oblivious statistics. We have
shown general truths regarding Instagram such that the commonly
sought out audience size is a poor metric for influence.

In our work, we did not consider the temporal nature of influence,
i.e., the influence of a user is likely to change over time. The rate of
change may even depend on the influence itself, as per the rich get
richer phenomenon [5].
Lastly, only simple user and posts statistics were used in this
work. We believe the use of more complex features would result
in stronger models and a better ranking algorithm. These features
can be post specific, from the simple "day of the week" to complex
"contains faces" [6, 41], user specific, e.g. the user’s age or common
content type [28, 29], or features relating to a user’s audience, such
as audience location or age [21, 34].
