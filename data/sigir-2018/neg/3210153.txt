and prefer the cheapest option, some other users would rather pay
a high price for a higher-standard service. It is also very common
for some users to use the ride sharing app to request a taxi pickup.
In light of the diversity in people’s needs, ride sharing companies
are providing multiple services for users to choose, which, however,
puts an extra burden for users. Sometimes, a user has to swipe
several times to find the exact line-of-business (s)he is looking for.
In this paper, we model users’ choice of services, and build classifiers to predict the user’s choice when opening the app. Intuitively,
such choices are correlated with several features: (a) the services
that the users have chosen in previous trips, and (b) the current
time and location of the users.
For each feature, we first characterize its correlation with the
choice of services using mutual information, and then build a predictive model with the feature. We also combine all features based
on an ensemble model. Finally, we conduct offline simulation experiments to verify the effectiveness of our models with realworld
data. The results show that our ensemble model performs very
well. In addition, although all of our models increase the prediction
accuracy from the majority-guess baseline, no particular model
outperforms all other models for all user groups.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 briefly
reviews the related work. In Section 3, we formalize the prediction
task, the evaluation metrics, and the experiment setup. In Section 4,
we describe the prediction models based on sequential features,
spatial features, and temporal features. We compare the performance of different models in Section 5. We discuss the limitation
and future work in Section 6 and conclude in Section 7.

ABSTRACT
Ride sharing apps like Uber and Didi Chuxing have played an important role in addressing the users’ transportation needs, which
come not only in huge volumes, but also in great variety. While
some users prefer low-cost services such as carpooling or hitchhiking, others prefer more pricey options like taxi or premier services.
Further analyses suggest that such preference may also be associated with different time and location. In this paper, we empirically
analyze the preferred services and propose a recommender system
which provides service recommendation based on temporal, spatial,
and behavioral features. Offline simulations show that our system
achieves a high prediction accuracy and reduces the user’s effort in
finding the desired service. Such a recommender system allows a
more precise scheduling for the platform, and enables personalized
promotions.

INTRODUCTION

Ride sharing has become an increasingly popular option for people
to meet their travel needs. Ride-sharing platforms such as Uber
and Didi Chuxing have been growing rapidly in the past few years,
completing more than 4 billion1 and 7 billion2 rides in year 2017
alone. The growing popularity has also led to an increase in the
diversity of users’ requests. While some users are cost-sensitive

RELATED WORK

Our work is related to prediction and recommendation problems in
transportation systems, especially in modeling the travel need of
the passengers. Yet existing works focus more on the destination
prediction [5, 8] and demand prediction [4]. The most relevant work
is [8], which focuses on the prediction of the destination based on
spatio-temporal contexts. Our work adopts a similar approach, but
we focus on a novel aspect of the travel need, i.e. the preferred
service. The use of contexts in prediction is inspired by the research
on context-aware recommender systems [1]. In fact, the use of
spatio-temporal contexts in user modeling has been well studied
in information retrieval and recommender system community (e.g.
[6, 7]).

% of trips in Express, Premier, Taxi, Hitch

Our analysis is conducted in Didi Chuxing 3 , which provides worldleading ride sharing services. The most popular four are:
Express Express service offers the affordable mobility service
where passengers can request for individual or pooled rides.
Express made up more than 70% of the trips on RidsS.
Premier Premier service offers high-end mobility experience
with luxury vehicles and drivers trained with highest service
standards.
Taxi Taxi service works with city-registered taxis and sends
passengers’ pickup requests to nearby taxis.
Hitch Hitch provides a social carpooling platform that helps
commuters find/provide carpool service to save the cost.

Figure 1, although these users are merely 18% of the aforementioned
active users, they contributed more than 67% of the total orders.
We hold out the last week of the 3 months as the test period, and
used the rest as the training period. The week of the test period is
a normal week without any national holidays or disruptive events.
We sampled 19,985 users who have 10 or more trips in the 3-month
period and at least 1 trip in both training and test period. Descriptive
statistics is shown in Table1

Prediction Task

The prediction task we tackle in this paper is given as follows: Given
the historical behavior of a user and the spatio-temporal context,
how well can we predict the service which the user will request. In
particular, we base our analysis on the following historical data and
spatio-temporal contexts:
• The time and location of each request the user has submitted
in the past, together with the service chosen by the user.
• Current time and location at the time of prediction.

3.4

Arguably, there are other useful features, such as the intended
destination. However, for the current design of the application, the
user has to choose the service tab before entering the destination,
so the destination of the current request would not be available
at the time of prediction. The destinations of previous trips could
be helpful, and we plan to incorporate such information in future
work.

3.3

% order
% user

80%

Each line of business is presented as a tab in the app. Once the
user decides on a line of service, (s)he can input her/his origin,
destination, and scheduled departure time (if not immediate). The
user will then see an estimated price and can send the request. The
prediction task takes place at the moment a user launches Didi. The
user would land our predicted service tab upon opening the app,
while (s)he can always switch to other tabs at any time.

Baseline

Before introducing our models, we will first evaluate the performance of a few simple baselines.
Majority: Since Express service is the most affordable and accessible among the four services, by majority guessing, we would predict
Express for all trips. This trivial baseline would result in an accuracy
of 0.72 and an F1-score of 0.21.
Local Majority: Although in the city level, the Express service is
the most popular choice, the case can be different in different local
areas. For example, in a high-end residential community or the
CBD, most users would prefer the Premier service. Therefore, we
implement a basic grid structure by partitioning the map in to 1
km2 square cells and calculate the most popular service in each
cell to make prediction. We would then predict the local majority
service to all trips within the same sell. This results in an accuracy
of 0.74 and an F1-score of 0.31.

Evaluation Metrics and Experiment Setup

Since the prediction task is a classic multi-class classification problem, we would use accuracy as the evaluation metric. However,
since more than 70% trips are made with Express, the classification
task suffers from imbalanced data. Therefore, we will also report
the macro-F1 score, in order to make sure the classifier is fair to all
services. This is crucial in assuring the product team to adopt our
model without harming any particular line-of-business.
The experiment is conducted on a metropolitan area with over
10 million population. In consecutive 3-month time, over 4 million
active users have made one or more trips in this city using Didi.
However, a majority of them have only made a few trips. In this
work, we focus on those more active users of the app, that is, users
with 10 or more trips in the same 3-month period. As shown in

MODELING USER BEHAVIOR IN CONTEXT

The two baselines perform poorly simply because they ignore the
difference between different users. A natural idea is to extend the
majority guess to individual level, that is, we use the most frequently
used service of each user to predict his/her next trip. A simple
simulation shows that such an Individual Majority model achieves
an accuracy of 0.83 and an F1-score of 0.70.

are much larger than that of the most recent used service shown in
Section 4.1.
Spatial Model: Although the grid structure greatly reduces the
entropy in the training set, creating a “Cell Majority” model for
each user would not generalize well in the testing period due to
data sparsity. Here, we adopt the decision tree classifier and build a
decision tree for each user to model the user-specific relationship
between location and service. The model is trained with CART with
all default parameters.
Temporal Model: Unlike spatial features where the location of
a POI is typically fixed, the temporal distribution of the requests
suffers less from sparsity. Therefore, we adopt a Gaussian Mixture
Model approach. Exploratory analysis suggests that k = 2 components are enough to capture most of the trips of a service used
by a user. Note that for the time of the day, 23:59 is very close to
00:01, such variables are called circular quantities [3]. We adapt the
approach reported in [8] to calculate the mean and variance of the
distribution, and we modify the traditional GMM accordingly to
account for the circular quantities.

4.1

Sequential Models

We can see that the Individual Majority’s performance is much
higher than the baselines, which suggests that users’ choice may
be dependent on their previous trips. In fact, if we use S t to represent the service of the t-th trip of a user. The entropy of the user’s
choice H (S) is 0.48 on average. Yet the conditional entropy given
the user’s choice in the last trip is 0.4, suggesting a mutual information [2] of 0.08. Therefore, we propose two models to characterize
the relationship between sequential orders.
Last Used: The first model assumes that users will choose the same
service as their last trip.
Markov: A more general approach is to use a Markov matrix to
model the correlation between the chosen service with the most
recent trip. That is, we use a Markov matrix M to characterize the
conditional probability of choosing service S t conditioned on the
service chosen last time S t −1 .
In fact, the Last Used model and the Individual Majority models
are two special cases. In the Last Used model, the transition matrix
is essentially an identity matrix, while in the Individual Majority,
one column of the transition matrix is 1 and the rest is zero. See
Figure 2 for illustration.

4.3

Ensemble Model

So far, we have introduced several different models, each of which
utilizes a particular feature: The Markov model utilizes the sequential feature, the Spatial model utilizes the spatial feature, and the
Temporal utilizes the temporal features. These models allow us to
measure how much improvement each feature brings, however
different users may benefit from different models since their preference may be more correlated with some features than others. It
is desirable to have one unified model that combine all features.
However, an excessively complex model would surely suffer
from sparsity. Besides, some features are highly correlated with
each other. For example, for users that take Hitch from home to
work in the morning and Express from work to home in the evening,
either location or time alone would be sufficient. Thus, we decide
to apply the ensemble approach.[9].
Ensemble: The three models, namely Markov, Spatial, and Temporal vote on their best guesses with equal weight and the service
with the most vote is the final prediction. In case of tie (all three
models predicts differently), the prediction from Spatial model is
chosen.

Spatio-Temporal Model

One essential element missing in majority guessing and the sequential model is that users take trips for different purposes. For
example, Jim uses Didi for all his travel needs. For his morning
commute from the suburban area, he may prefer to request a Hitch,
which is not only affordable, but also available as many nearby
residents are heading towards downtown at that time. When he
heads out of the CBD in the afternoon to meet a potential customer,
he might prefer a Premier for business purpose.
This intriguing example suggests the importance of understanding the purpose of the users. The destination of a trip would be
the ideal indicator of the purpose. Yet in the current application,
without knowing the destination of the trip at the time of prediction, we decide to directly predict the choice of service from the
spatio-temporal features of the trip origin.
In fact, such spatial and temporal features are strongly correlated with the choice of service. The mutual information between
the service and the location (indexed by the aforementioned grid
structure) is 0.288, and the mutual information between the service
and the time (indexed by the hour of day) is 0.293, both of which

COMPARISON OF DIFFERENT MODELS

Following the experiment setup described in Section 3.3, we compare the performance of different models. We further break down
our analysis on users with different levels of activities, based on
their number of trips made in the training periods. In Figure 3, we
split users into five bins such that the number of users in each bin
is similar. The accuracy of the models is plotted in Figures 3, and
we can make several observations:
The Last Used model achieves the highest performance for the
most inactive users. It even performs better than its more generalized form Markov Model. This suggests that these users are more
likely to request the same service as they did last time. As we have
discussed, the Last Used model is a special case of the Markov model,
yet for the inactive users, the Last Used out-performs the Markov

model. This is probably because there is not enough training data
to estimate the Markov matrix.
The Ensemble model achieves the highest performance for users
with a medium level of activities. It outperforms the three individual
models. These users can be heterogeneous, and a same feature
cannot models the behavior of all user in this group.
The Spatial model achieves the highest performance for the most
active users. These users have incorporated the Didi app into their
daily life. Their preference of service is strongly associated with
the location where they launch Didi.
The Individual Majority model has an increasing performance
as the activity level gets higher. This suggests that the more active
an user is, the more concentrated his/her requested service is.
Since the data set is highly unbalanced, we also report the macroF1 score (unweighted mean of the F1 score of each class) in Figure 4.
Although the values of the score is hard to interpret, it can tell us
that our model is fair to all four types of services (when compared
with the Majority and Local Majority model). We can see that the
comparison of different models is similar to that in Figure 3. The Last
Used model performs best for in-active users while the Ensemble
and Spatial model perform best for active users.

provide strong incentives for the users to choose a certain service.
For another example, the “default” option offered by the system
could also affect the user’s preference without the user knowing
it. The current app interface implements a Last Used model as the
default choice. Could that be the reason why the Last Used works
well for inactive users? We plan to explore these in our future work.

CONCLUSION

In this paper, we study a novel problem of predicting the line-ofbusiness that a user is going to use for his/her next ride sharing trip.
We model the problem as a multi-class classification and propose
several classifiers based on sequential, spatial, and temporal features.
Offline simulations show that no particular classifier out-performs
other classifiers and an ensemble model achieves the best overall
performance. Our work serves as a necessary step to model and
predict the users’ travel need, which can help ride sharing platforms
to do a more effective scheduling.

DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK

Although our models have shown great improvement over the
baselines, there are still a lot to explore to improve our prediction:
Adding More Features: Our model can greatly benefit from including more features. For example, the type of the origin POI
(business, residential, shopping, etc.) would allow us to better understand the purpose of the trip, which translates into the preferred
line-of-business.
Counting for the Supply: So far, our analysis focuses only on
the demand (passenger) side of the ride sharing. Yet the supply
(driver/vehicle) side can also affect users’ choice. For example, many
drivers only work as Express drivers during the weekend. Thus,
an experienced user knowing such supply pattern would avoid
requesting Express on weekdays.
Controlling Other Contexts: Other contexts may potentially affect the user’s choice. For example, the coupons and promotions
