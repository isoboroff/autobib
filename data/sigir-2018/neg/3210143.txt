ABSTRACT

why it is controversial at all. How would she search for people’s
opinions to better understand the conflicting stances on this topic?
One straightforward approach to this problem would be for
the user to search the topic and manually scan the search results
until she has read enough conflicting tweets to understand the
controversy. However, current search systems make this navigation
difficult due to the filter bubble effect. For example, the top posts are
likely to be the ones that the user agrees with because her friends
liked the posts or she or her friends follow the authors.
Another strategy for navigating Twitter is to identify a few key
hashtags that indicate stances and then search for posts that contain
them. As people are forced to write posts under the strict character
limit, certain hashtags are utilized as self-created labels for their
opinions (e.g., #imwithher in support of Hillary Clinton or #MAGA
in support of Donald Trump during the 2016 US presidential election). However, because the use of hashtags (even the ones that
seemingly contain obvious stances) are known to be noisy [12], the
user must still carefully read each tweet. More importantly, she has
to go through a large number of noisy tweets that are not useful
to understand the controversy while using her own judgment to
identify their stance (if they even have one). This process requires
substantial effort, critical reasoning, and phenomenal patience. It is
clear that users could benefit from automating this process.
We propose a technique that generates a stance-aware summary
by selecting the top tweets that best explain a given controversy.
Our contributions are as follows:

In an era in which new controversies rapidly emerge and evolve
on social media, navigating social media platforms to learn about a
new controversy can be an overwhelming task. In this light, there
has been significant work that studies how to identify and measure
controversy online. However, we currently lack a tool for effectively
understanding controversy in social media. For example, users have
to manually examine postings to find the arguments of conflicting
stances that make up the controversy.
In this paper, we study methods to generate a stance-aware
summary that explains a given controversy by collecting arguments
of two conflicting stances. We focus on Twitter and treat stance
summarization as a ranking problem of finding the top k tweets that
best summarize the two conflicting stances of a controversial topic.
We formalize the characteristics of a good stance summary and
propose a ranking model accordingly. We first evaluate our methods
on five controversial topics on Twitter. Our user evaluation shows
that our methods consistently outperform other baseline techniques
in generating a summary that explains the given controversy.

INTRODUCTION

• This work appears to be the first unsupervised approach to
automatically summarize controversy on social media.
• We characterize what makes a tweet a good summary of controversy, propose three attributes that should be satisfied (i.e.,
stance-indicativeness, articulation, and topic relevance), and develop methods to estimate them.
• We propose a novel method to estimate the confidence of stanceindication using automatically-obtained stance hashtags, which
have typically been used to filter data during manual annotation.
• We extensively evaluate various methods including a general
summarization technique and our methods via user evaluation
and demonstrate that the summaries generated by our methods
explain controversy better than the ones by other techniques.

Online controversies often emerge and evolve quickly due to the
nature of social media. These platforms such as Twitter and Facebook encourage users to be concise and allow them to be casual,
requiring less effort to post something compared to other platforms,
such as Wikipedia and blogs. While existing techniques enable us
to identify whether a topic is controversial, understanding why it is
controversial is still left as work for users. For instance, consider the
following scenario: A person discovers a new hashtag movement
#TakeaKnee1 on Twitter but does not know what it is about or
1 This

was prevalent during the US national anthem protests that began in 2017.

RELATED WORK

This research is related to a few areas: summarization and controversy analysis on social media.
Twitter Summarization: There has been much work on summarizing Twitter postings while most of them focuses on summarizing events [1, 4, 8, 18, 20]. Inouye et al. [13] compare multiple

summarization algorithms for Tweet data, and their extensive experiments suggest that the SumBasic algorithm produced the best
F1-result in human evaluation, which we also adopt as a summarization baseline in this paper. Some work has focused on generating
contrastive summaries from opinionated text [7, 15]. Particularly,
Guo et al. studied tweet data to find a controversy summary. They
find a pair of contrastive opinions by integrating manually-curated
expert opinions and clustering the pairs to generate a summary.
However, their model needs curated expert opinions, which requires
constant human effort to maintain as the topic evolves.
Controversy Analysis on the Web: To identify controversial
topics in Web documents, some work has demonstrated that identifying relevant Wikipedia pages as well as building a controversy
language model is effective [3, 9, 11]. Several studies then have
formally defined a model for controversy detection [10, 21]. This
work defines that controversy should be identified with respect to
a given population (or community). Existing work also has focused
on identifying controversy on Twitter [5, 6, 17]. Garimella et al. and
Fraisier et al. analyze user retweet or follow graphs, which signifies
the formation of exclusive communities of like-minded people for
controversial topics. Our approach builds on these earlier findings.

P(ΓA |τ ) = f (PS (SA |τ ), PA (τ ), PT (τ |T ))

(1)

where PS (SA |τ ) computes how likely a tweet indicates SA , PA (τ )
computes how articulate the tweet is, and PT (τ |T ) computes how
relevant the tweet is for the topic.
In the next section, we discuss how to estimate the first two
scores. For the topic relevance score, we use the straightforward
probability that the tweet sentence was generated from the language model of the given topic, normalized by the tweet length.

Estimating Stance-indication

To estimate stance-indication, we first identify stance hashtags that
statistically characterize the stance community. We use the stance
hashtags as a proxy to estimate the tweets that indicate the same
stance as follows:
Õ
PS (SA |τ ) =
P(h|τ ) · PS (SA |h) · P(h)
h ∈H

Then the score boils down to estimating P(h|τ ), a probability that
the tweet includes a given hashtag h, and PS (SA |h), a score that
indicates how likely h represents SA . As SA and SB are mutually
exclusive, we penalize ambiguous tweets that are likely to contain
stance hashtags of the opposing side by subtracting the score for
the opposite stance as follows:
Õ 
Õ 


PS (SA |τ ) =
P(h|τ ) · PS (SA |h) −
P(h|τ ) · PS (SB |h)

APPROACH

We first discuss what makes a tweet a good summary. We then
develop a ranking model that ranks the tweets by how likely a
tweet is part of a good summary. Finally, we propose two methods
to select the summary from the ranked tweets.

h ∈HB

where HA and HB are the set of stance hashtags that represent SA
and SB respectively.

Based on the definition of controversy by previous work, we define
a good controversy summary as a description that effectively captures different arguments of two communities that take conflicting
stances with each other. After examining many examples (see Table
1), we derive three primary components that characterize a good
controversy summary tweet.
• Stance-indicative (S): A good tweet strongly indicates its stance
and is often followed by some particular stance hashtags that are
widely used by users from the same stance community.
• Articulation (A): A good tweet is clear, persuasive, and logical.
It is also written with proper language.
• Topic Relevance (T): A good tweet is self-explanatory and
relevant in the context of a particular topic.
For any controversial topic T , we assume that there are always
two stances that are in conflict with each other. We denote these
stances as SA and SB . Let Γ be a summary of a given topic T . We let
Γ = [ΓA , ΓB ] that denotes the summary of SA and SB , respectively.
We define a model that computes whether a tweet τ is likely to be

3.2.1 Identifying Stance Hashtags (HA , HB ). To obtain a set
of stance hashtags, we first identify two communities, C A and
C B , each of which represents the group that holds SA and SB ,
respectively. Following the same procedure introduced by Garimella
et al., we construct a user retweet (RT) graph and partition it into
two groups [6]. We use a simple method that produces only two
communities so as not to deal with the extra step of classifying
several identified communities to two stances. We leave identifying
multiple communities and clustering them into one of the stances
of interest to generate the summaries from for the future work.
Once we identify C A and C B , we assume that tweets that are
written by users from C A and C B are likely to indicate SA and SB
respectively. From the two sets of tweets, we compute the information gain [19] that each hashtag gets for the information of the
community class when they are present in the tweets: if we know
nothing about the tweet but the hashtag presence, which hashtag
best indicates its stance community? Finally, we define HA , the set

of stance hashtag of SA , as follows:
HA = {h ∈ H |h ∈ TopN (IG, H ) ∧ freqA (h) > freqB (h)}
where IG is a function that returns the information gain value for
the two stance classes for a given hashtag, freqA is the frequency
of h in the tweets published from C A , and TopN (IG, H ) returns
the N items that have the highest scores from a given function IG
among the items in the given set H . In our experiments, we set
n = 30, which covers a sufficiently high number of tweets in the
communiy given that the distribution of hashtag frequency follows
the power law [16]. We then let PS (S A |h) be the normalized score
of IG(h) for all hashtags in the set HA .

Summary Selection

3.2.2 Estimating P(h|τ ) via Latent Hashtags. If we think of hashtags as user-generated annotations, hashtags are incomplete annotations. This means that a lack of a certain hashtag does not
necessarily imply that it is not a relevant label. To better utilize
hashtags as more accurate signals, we make hashtags more complete
annotations by estimating P(h|τ ) for all hashtags, the probability
that tweet τ generates a hashtag h. Therefore, we adopt a character composition model, Tweet2Vec, which finds a vector space
representation of tweets to predict user-annotated hashtags [2].
The model computes the hashtag posterior probability for a given
tweet for all hashtags in their softmax layer in order to find the top
hashtag predictions. We use this probability as P(h|τ ) for hashtags
that were not explicitly used in the given tweet.

We propose two algorithms that aggregate the three probability
scores to generate the final k summary, which we set as 10 in our
experiments. To produce a final summary to equally cover two
stances, both algorithms select k/2 tweets from each stance.
SumSAT ranks the tweets by setting the aggregation function
f (in Eq. 1) to be a harmonic mean for the three scores described
earlier. HashtagSumSAT, on the other hand, while using the same
aggregation function, first identifies the top k/2 stance hashtags
for each stance and selects the top tweet for each hashtag. While
we use a harmonic mean as f , any aggregator can be plugged in.
The difference of the two algorithms come from whether it globally
ranks the tweets or ranks the tweets per each hashtag.

Estimating the level of articulation

We build a regression model that predicts how well the tweet is
written and generate an annotated set of 150 articulate and 150
non-articulate tweets on arbitrary topics. The annotation criteria
between the two classes is whether the given tweet is logical, the
grammar is sound, and it is written with proper language.
Similarly, Duan et al. propose a classifier to evaluate the content
quality of tweets [4]. In addition to their features, we include a large
set of POS tags that are Twitter-specific provided by TweeboParser
[14], N-grams of the POS tags sequence to capture the structural
flow of the good sentences, and the ratio of offensive words to
penalize usage of inappropriate language, as shown in Table 2. This
model is generalizable since the features are not content-specific.
We trained a logistic regression model and obtained 89.9% classification accuracy using 5-fold cross validation.

We evaluate our methods by running them on real data and conducting user studies to capture the utility of our algorithms.

Experiment Setup

We consider five controversial topics including two short-term,
event-based controversies (2016 US Presidential Election and 2017
US National Anthem Protests which we refer to as #TakeAKnee),
and three long-term ethics-related controversies (Abortion, Feminism, and Climate Change).
Our goal is to generate a summary that can explain why the
topic is controversial. For each topic, we generate a pair of summaries and ask 10 participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk which
summary better explains the controversy in a double-blind fashion.
A pair of summaries were compared twice by two participants. The
participants could also say that the quality of the two summaries is
the same. To observe whether a subset of tweets whose author’s
stance is identified from the community generates a better quality
summary, we experiment with two cases for each algorithm: (1) using all tweets as summary candidates or (2) using only tweets whose
author belongs to one of two stance communities we identified.
We distinguish the second case by adding ‘C’ (for the community)
to the method name. We also generate summaries including the
following baseline methods:

Results and Discussion

recommendations expressed in this material are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect those of the sponsor.

The evaluation shows that our methods were consistently more
effective than other baselines across all five topics (Figure 1). Overall,
SumSAT generated the summaries that were preferred the most
(68%) followed by HashtagSumSAT-C (61%).
We learned that in identifying and finding stance-indicative
tweets, social features are far more important than the content
itself. For example, mostRT outperforms a general summarization
technique that only considers the text content most of the time. This
finding aligns with the findings of the previous study on detecting
controversy on Twitter [6]. However, depending on the topic and
the day, mostRT can also be the worst feature, even worse than
random selection as in the case for the topic of Feminism. For example, the top retweets in Feminism include ‘Happy International
Women’s day!’. Retweets can often be tweets for entertainment
and can easily be dominated by people on one side of the controversy who are more vocal on Twitter.
Our evaluation also suggests that stance hashtags are particularly
effective to generate a summary around for event-based controversies, such as the US Election and US Anthem Protest. This is
because stance hashtags have been more actively used in these topics as there are usually specific actions that people try to promote
or discourage via the hashtags.

CONCLUSION

We introduce and tackle a new task of generating a stance-aware
summary to explain controversy on social media. We first characterize three aspects that a desirable summary should satisfy:
stance-indication, articulation and topic relevance. We propose a
probablistic ranking model that estimates the probability score for
each aspect and combines them to find the best summary from
the user stance communities. Our human evaluation shows that
our summaries are preferred over other baseline summaries in
understanding controversy.
