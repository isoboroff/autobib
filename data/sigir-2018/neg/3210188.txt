ABSTRACT

The key challenge in health search is how to bridge the sematic
gap: the mismatch between the raw data and the way a human being interprets it. Although particularly prevalent in health search,
the semantic gap problem is found in all domains [1]; advances in
health search can thus advance the whole field. Key challenges include: how to leverage semantics and domain-knowledge resources
for a better representation of documents and information needs [27];
what characterises relevance, in particular how topicality is complemented by other dimensions of relevance [64] (understandability, authoritativeness, etc.), how bias and time pressure affect perception of relevance and decisions [34, 39, 60] and how these influences the search process and evaluation.
Advances in health search will require familiarity with the tasks,
users, successes, failures, and domain-specific resources. This tutoACM Reference Format:

The HS2018 tutorial will cover topics from an area of information retrieval (IR) with significant societal impact — health search.
Whether it is searching patient records, helping medical professionals find best-practice evidence, or helping the public locate reliable and readable health information online, health search is a
challenging area for IR research with an actively growing community and many open problems. This tutorial will provide attendees
with a full stack of knowledge on health search, from understanding users and their problems to practical, hands-on sessions on
current tools and techniques, current campaigns and evaluation
resources, as well as important open questions and future directions.

3 FORMAT AND SCHEDULE
3.1 Session 1: Background and theory
Introduction to the health domain and to the
tutorial
The tutorial begins with an introduction to IR in health, giving an
overview of the topics that will be covered in the tutorial and why
they are important.
Duration: 15m

This section covers the state-of-the-art in health search, summarising the most important research methods and results in this area
with respect to the different tasks discussed in the previous session and highlighting common trends across tasks. This session
will cover methods across different health search tasks, including:
query expansion and reformulation [2, 33, 42, 43, 47, 52, 54, 62, 63],
use of domain knowledge and inference mechanisms [12, 15, 26, 27,
30, 44, 65], learning to rank and other learning methods [3, 6, 31, 32,
35, 36, 43, 49–51], task-based information [23, 29], and specifically
handling clinical text [7, 8, 17, 22, 24, 28]. We provide examples of
health search systems already in use and lessons that can be drawn
from their use.
Duration: 90m

3.3 Session 3: Practical
Use of clinical NLP tools for medical IR:
Hands-on session
The clinical informatics and clinical natural language processing
community have developed a number of tools for extracting clinical information free text. For example, statistical and dictionarybased named entity recognition systems have been developed to
identify medical entities [5, 19, 48]; algorithms have been developed to extract associations, relationships and contexts and to enhance textual content with semantic information [11, 16, 59]. This
part of the tutorial presents an overview of such techniques, providing a hands-on demonstration of how these tools work. In addition, the tutorial provides an outlook at how these tools have been
used in the literature or can be integrated to enhance information
representation and the whole information retrieval process.
Duration: 90m

3.4 Session 4: Evaluation and future directions
Evaluation

Types of health information

The tasks and challenges in evaluating health search are covered in
this section. Evaluation that considers multiple dimensions of relevance (topicality, reliability, understandability [64], bias [60]) is
presented. We touch on new frameworks to evaluate systems based
on task completion rather than relevance [23]. Evaluation campaigns and resources in this domain are presented, including TREC
Medical Records Track [55, 57, 58], TREC Clinical Decision Support Track [40, 41, 46], CLEF eHealth (consumer health search [13,
14, 38, 67] and as of 2017 search systems for the compilation of
systematic reviews [20, 45]), i2b2 Shared Task Challenges³, ALTA
Shared Task (Query-based summarisation for evidence-based medicine) [4], clinical trial retrieval [25], and the use of ICD coded data
as an automated relevance judgement mechanism [21].
Duration: 50m

Health information comes in a myriad of forms. This section covers
the characteristics of different types of health information sources
important for health search. These range from patient-based information (e.g., electronic health records), knowledge-based information (e.g., scientific papers), through to consumer-based information (e.g., patient forums on the web). Also included are sources
of domain knowledge such as medical ontologies, terminologies
and classification systems, all of which are playing an increasingly
important role in state-of-the-art IR systems.
Duration: 30m

End users and tasks
An analysis of the end user (from consumer [10, 61, 66] to clinician [37, 53]) characteristics and tasks in health search is presented.
Some groups of end users are addressed, and the information needs
and search tasks they undertake are described: examples of users
and search tasks are listed in Figure 1.
Duration: 45m

There are many open problems in health search which are fertile
ground for information retrieval (IR) research. Examples include:
(i) searching for “similar” anonymised patient records or “similar”
medical images within a hospital to assist in diagnosis or treatment; (ii) linking treatment guidelines to patient records based
on their content; (iii) searching within a patient record to obtain
an overview of someones medical history. This part of the tutorial briefly presents some of the areas of medicine and consumerhealth experience that have a potential to be improved through the
use of IR techniques, leading to a discussion with the participants
on meeting these challenges.

RELEVANCE TO THE IR COMMUNITY

Health related topics have become a common theme within IR.
A number of venues, including SIGIR, have workshops, tutorials
or tracks dedicated to health search. In recent times, SIGIR has
had both tutorials (2012) and workshops (2014 and 2016). Similarly, other venues such as WSDM, WWW, KDD, and ACL have
all hosted health related tutorials or workshops, with the most recent being an ECIR 2018 tutorial that focuses on semantic search
on medical texts. This shows the interest from the community in
health search. Even so, a number of important aspects of health
search were never covered and are thus the focus of this tutorial:
• This tutorial will clearly provide an understanding of the users,
their information needs, tasks and challenges that exist in this
domain. This is critical as many of these differ from other domains.
• Practical sessions will provide attendees with hands-on experience with health search techniques, tools and problems.
• The tutorial will conclude with an analysis of open questions in
the domain.
It is our intention to provide attendees with a full stack of knowledge in health search, from understanding the problems, practical
solutions and fruitful areas of future work. It is our hope that this
will equip them to contribution to an area of growing interest in
the field with significant societal impact.
