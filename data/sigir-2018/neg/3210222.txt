Second, we consider the novel task of diversifying passage retrieval results. Some document diversification methods aim to cover
the different query aspects by positioning at top ranks documents
that are both likely to be relevant and dissimilar from each other
[12]. Passages are more likely to discuss a single aspect than their
ambient document. Therefore, diversification methods that utilize
inter-passage similarities might yield more diversified and relevant
results both for document and passage retrieval. Recently, a diversification method for short streams of text was proposed [8]; we
plan to adapt this method for passage-retrieval diversification as a
first step.
To provide a solid empirical testbed for the methods we develop,
benchmarks with focused relevance judgments (e.g., the INEX [2]
and WebAP [4] datasets) are required. We intend to initiate a crowdsourcing effort in order to enrich TREC datasets with focused relevance judgments.

ABSTRACT
Our main goal is studying the merits of using inter-passage similarities for the task of focused retrieval; i.e., ranking passages in
documents by their relevance to an information need expressed
by a query. As an initial research direction we study the cluster
hypothesis for passage (focused) retrieval. We propose a novel suite
of cluster hypothesis tests that employ inter-passage similarities
and demonstrate that the cluster hypothesis holds for passages. In
addition, we present several future directions we intend to pursue.

INTRODUCTION

One of the drawbacks of retrieving documents in response to a
query is that a relevant document might be long and address several
topics, some of which are not related to the information need. Hence,
passage retrieval approaches have been proposed; that is, ranking
short units of text in response to a query (e.g., [2, 4, 9]).
Inter-document similarity measures play an important role in
many information retrieval applications, including cluster-based
(e.g., [3, 5, 10, 15]) and graph-based (e.g., [1, 6]) document retrieval
methods, and search results diversification approaches [12]. Passages are presumably more topically coherent than documents;
hence, inter-passage similarities were also used for inducing interdocument similarity measures [7, 11].
The theoretical basis for using inter-document similarity measures for document retrieval is the cluster hypothesis that states:
“closely associated documents tend to be relevant to the same requests” [3, 14]. In this proposal, we opt to explore the use of interpassage similarities for passage (focused) retrieval; hence, we start
by testing the cluster hypothesis for passages [13]. The tests account
for the fraction of relevant text a passage contains (i.e., focused relevance judgments [2]). We show that the cluster hypothesis holds
for passages according to the tests we devised [13]. More specifically, passages that contain a high fraction of relevant text are more
similar to other relevant passages than to non-relevant passages,
and particularity to those with a high fraction of relevant text [13].
Motivated by the above findings, we plan to pursue two venues
in future work. First, we intend to study the adaptation of clusterbased document retrieval methods to the passage retrieval setting.
Specifically, we plan to pursue the following research questions: (i)
Which inter-passage similarity measures can be used for improving
passage retrieval? (ii) How can they be integrated? (cf., [11]).
