BIOGRAPHY

Didi Chuxing is the largest ride-sharing platform in China,
providing transportation services for over 400 million users.
Every day, Didi Chuxing’s platform generates over 100 TB worth
of data, processes more than 40 billion routing requests, and
produces over 15 billion location points. In this talk, I will
explain how Didi Chuxing applies big data and AI technologies
to analyze big transportation data and improve the travel
experience for millions of users.
