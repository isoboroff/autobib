track record of academic success also exhibit lower rates of notetaking (c.f. Fig. 1). Hence, LessonWare addresses a need to help
mentor note-taking and reflection skills as students take notes.
The LessonWare middleware system (Figure 1) is designed to
1) access lecture capture recordings from any participating vendor
or educational institution and use available third-party tools to
create a rough transcript of what was said in class, 2) ingest notes
from students in participating courses from multiple student notetaking clients, and 3) access content resources from external
commercial and open education sources.
LessonWare employs machine learning with the available
transcript and student notes to create contextual connections
between these systems. For example, students taking notes in an
introductory biology course are able to view a clustering of notes
from the whole class (analogous to Facebook’s “What’s Trending”
but specific to a student’s class) with direct linkage to specific

ABSTRACT
A new educational service has been prototyped by Echo360 that
uses natural language processing to analyze students notes and
provide personalized recommendations on how to both improve
note-taking and scaffold learning. The LessonWare middleware
system uses computer-generated transcriptions from class
captures and available student notes to identify key terms
mentioned during class sessions. The combination of analyzed key
terms and corresponding timestamps allows contextual linkages
to be created between educational resources. Student notes are
automatically augmented with corresponding moments in class
captures, specific pages in the course eTextbook or open
education resources or specific adaptive learning assets.

1 INTRODUCTION
* It is generally accepted that note-taking benefits learning
(Christopoulos et al., 1987; Jansen et al., 2017). But while most
college students take notes not every student necessarily
understands best practices for or appreciates the value of taking
and reflecting on their notes nor do they have access to peer
examples from specific courses to see how others manage their
note-taking. Poor note-taking skills are not uncommon in all
populations of students (Bui et al., 2013; Luo et al., 2016) but
disproportionally include students experiencing lower levels of
academic success (Boyle et al., 2016). Students who have a poor

education (Boyle et al., 2016). Good note-taking practices can lead
to efficient study practices, better course outcomes, and improved
retention of content beyond a course’s conclusion. While students
with poor note-taking skills tend to do less well (Nye, 1978) the
teaching of note-taking and reflection skills is limited (Williams &
Eggert, 2002). Spickard et al. (2008) collected medical student
notes to augment mentor feedback on patient write-ups which led
to more frequent and detailed feedback than for a corresponding
control group.
Using LessonWare, note-taking platforms add the ability to
gamify note-taking. Using the raw notes from class and the
transcript of the instructor, questions can be selected from
external question repositories and presented to students for selfassessment of their knowledge in preparation for a future exam.
In fact, note-taking will be incentivized because the depth and
number of questions provided for self-assessment can be designed
to grow with the number and depth of student notes.
Linking independent educational services — Another challenge to
the education technology industry in general is the slow rate of
adoption of new pedagogies and practices by college and
university instructors. LessonWare addresses this challenge in
two ways: 1) it focuses on the design of student-centric tools that
do not necessarily require instructor participation and 2) it offers
a mechanism for contextual linkage between the resources
students use for study.

points in the class captures where the topic of a note cluster was
discussed and links established with open education resources
and/or participating content vendors. Likewise, students are able to
search through the combination class captures, notes, external
resources and course-associated textbook to locate specific content.
The LessonWare service expands lecture capture to “lesson
capture” using student artifacts generated during class to link
lecture capture, note-taking and content and/or assessment
platforms based on the context of class content. The availability
of machine-generated transcripts also allows users to search the
combination of class captures, notes and external resources for
specific terms or phrases with links to specific moments in class
captures when the searched term was mentioned.
A “NoteLinks” application has been prototyped to illustrate
how the LessonWare API can populate a prototype student study
platform. This student-centric application has the advantage that
it doesn’t require instructor participation, save for allowing the
course classes to be captured by a partner lecture capture
company or institution. The NoteLinks application presents a list
of “what’s trending” in aggregated class notes, thus giving
students insight into the nature and breadth of all notes shared in
the course. It is our hypothesis that exposure to the breadth of
notes taken in a class session will serve as a virtual mentor to
students unfamiliar or less engaged in note-taking. This service is
gamified as access to the aggregate of notes is designed to expand
with as the student contributes more notes.
Implementation of LessonWare into educational platforms is
based on the Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) standards as
developed by IMS Global Learning Consortium. LTI prescribes a
way to integrate rich learning applications with platforms like
learning management systems (LMS), portals, learning object
repositories or other educational environments managed locally
or in the cloud.
LessonWare serves two agendas:
1. Provide incentive for improved note-taking,
2. Provide a mechanism for contextual linkages between
independent educational services.
Improving Note-Taking — Virtually all college students take notes
in class and a substantial number of students prefer to take notes
on mobile devices. It is generally agreed that the act of taking
notes enhances students' recall of the content of a class and that
review of those notes also enhances recall (Hartley & Davies,
1978; Kiewra et al., 1991). While evidence exists that writing notes
is more beneficial to learning than typing notes (May, 2014;
Mueller & Oppenheimer, 2014), we have found (Samson, 2017)
that about half of University of Michigan college students,
surveyed over multiple semesters, preferred to type their notes on
laptops. Admittedly, these results may be different at different
educational institutions but we anticipate that note-taking
technologies will continue to evolve to allow students more
options for taking notes electronically including hand drawn and
written.
Regardless how students take notes, many students are
unaware of or do not appreciate the benefits that effective notetaking may have (Hartley & Davies, 1978), and the importance of
cultivating their note-taking skills over the course of their
