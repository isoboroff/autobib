humans and vehicles, policymakers and city planners can have
more informed advice on enhancing road networks, such as tidal
lanes and traffic signals. By pooling passengers and drivers together,
ride-sharing companies can reduce the waiting time of passengers
and increase the occupation rate of private vehicles. More broadly,
the more intelligent transportation would not only greatly enhance
our traveling experience, but also make transportation safer and
more environmental friendly.
With the vision of such an intelligent system, we propose the
idea of Intelligent Transportation Informatics (INI). The transportation system has come to an era where the abundant information
and the advanced machine learning, data mining, and decisionmaking algorithms can join forces to solve the issues we face in
transportation and make it more intelligent and efficient.
Such a vision align well with that of SIGIR. The information
retrieval, in its broad sense, is computational technologies which
connect people with information. Intelligent Transportation Informatics aims exactly at connecting transportation information to
people intelligently to better address people’s transportation need.

ABSTRACT
We propose a half-day workshop at SIGIR 2018 for the professionals,
researchers, and practitioners who are interested in mining and
understanding big and heterogeneous data generated in transportation to improve the transportation system. We plan to have both
paper presentations and invited talks.

MOTIVATION

Modern transportation is no longer powered by fuel or electricity
alone. It is powered by information as well. The recent advances
in sensing technology have led to a rapid increase in the types
and volumes of information we can know about the transportation.
With the development of large-scale computing infrastructures,
such information can be made available in real time and stored for
future analyses.
The smartphone, with GPS sensors and highspeed Internet connection, is one example of the game-changers that change how
we interact with the transportation system. With a glance at the
screen, we know where we are. Online map providers aggregate
location information to estimate the traffic condition in real time,
which provides travelers with a better estimate of traveling time,
and allow local authorities to respond more timely. Ride-sharing
companies like Uber and Didi are built upon such information as
well, as they connect drivers with passengers to provide efficient
hail-and-ride experience.
Yet the abundance of the transportation information provides
even more to expect, and we can envision a more intelligent transportation system: By studying the patterns of mobility data of

SCOPE AND TOPICS

Intelligent Transportation Informatics refers to the acquisition, integration, and analysis of heterogeneous information generated
in transportation, to improve the efficiency of the transportation
system. Intelligent Transportation Informatics involves ubiquitous
sensing technologies, advanced data management models, information analytics and retrieval algorithms, and novel visualization
methods. Intelligent Transportation Informatics helps us understand the underlying patterns of the modern transportation system, and create all-win solutions to all stakeholders, including
passengers/commuters, drivers, city planners, and policymakers.
Intelligent Transportation Informatics calls for interdisciplinary
collaborations between computer science and other fields, such
as transportation, economy, operational research, and computer
science.
Intelligent Transportation Informatics raise research questions
in several broad topics, which aligns well with the major area of
the SIGIR community:
Social Media Data Mining for Intelligent Transportation Research fusing information from both social media and transportation. Examples include mining social media data for transportation

demand prediction, monitoring social media for event and emergency detection, measuring and changing driver safety via social
media.
Classification, Recommendation, and Clustering on Traffic
Network Research using human and vehicle trajectory information
to model dynamic traffic network. Examples include modeling road
capacity, discovering and classifying new POI, filtering and recommending POI in dynamic contexts, real-time visualization of road
conditions, event and anomaly detection in the traffic networks,
new bus route recommendations, recommending traffic policy and
regulation with transformation information, etc.
Searching and Ranking in transportation context Research
that combines core IR algorithms with the dynamic spatio-temporal
context. Examples include location-aware query understanding and
disambiguation, destination suggestion and prediction, locationbased sponsored search, search advertising on local POI.
Human Factors in Intelligent Transportation Research on human behavioral analysis and user-centric application in transportation. Examples include mining and analysis on human mobility log,
user behavior modeling in the transportation context, personalized destination and route recommendation, transportation safety
modeling and intervention.
Artificial Intelligence for Transportation Research bridging AI
to transportation systems, especially in resource allocation and dialog systems. Examples include efficient taxi dispatching algorithms,
intelligent carpooling for passengers with similar routes, in-car dialog system, specialized intelligent personal assistants and agents.
Novel Applications and Future Direction Research focused on
novel and future subdomains in transportation. Examples include
smart city (intelligent traffic lights, tidal lane recommendation, etc.),
fusing social media data.
The workshop provides professionals, researchers and technologists with a platform to present the state-of-the-art development
and applications, share their envisions about the future of intelligent transportation informatics. At SIGIR, this workshop targets
people who are interested in mining and understanding transportation data and applying AI techniques in addressing the challenges in
current transportation systems. The workshop aligns well with the
general topic of SIGIR 2018, connecting people with information.
