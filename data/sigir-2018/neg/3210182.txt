Conducting Laboratory Experiments Properly
with Statistical Tools: An Easy Hands-on Tutorial

pair, conducting a standard t-test 4 ∗ 3/2 = 6 times is not the correct
approach (misuse); your p-value does not represent the probability that your research hypothesis is correct (misinterpretation).
Moreover, in the IR community, it appears that researchers seldom
learn from prior art when designing the sample size of an experiment. This can lead to heavily underpowered experiments, which
means that there is a high chance that the researchers will miss the
differences actually present, despite having spent their effort and
resources for these experiments.
The advent of R as a statistical tool has pros and cons. Pros:
anyone can download R for free and conduct statistical significance
tests very easily. Cons: anyone can conduct statistical significance
tests without understanding the underlying principles, assumptions,
and their limitations. If the IR community chooses to continue to
use statistical significance testing (although there are alternatives:
see, for example, Carterette [2] and Sakai [11]), then it must be understood and used properly. This is the motivation for this tutorial.

ABSTRACT
This hands-on half-day tutorial consists of two sessions. Part I covers the following topics: Preliminaries; Paired and two-sample t-tests,
confidence intervals; One-way ANOVA and two-way ANOVA without
replication; Familiwise error rate. Part II covers the following topics:
Tukey’s HSD test, simultaneous confidence intervals; Randomisation
test and randomised Tukey HSD test; What’s wrong with statistical
significance tests?; Effect sizes, statistical power; Topic set size design
and power analysis; Summary: how to report your results. Participants should have some prior knowledge about the very basics
of statistical significance testing and are strongly encouraged to
bring a laptop with R already installed. The tutorial participants
will be able to design and conduct statistical significance tests for
comparing the mean effectiveness scores of two or more systems
appropriately, and to report on the test results in an informative
manner.

MOTIVATION

Following ACM’s policy1 , ACM SIGIR has recently launched a
taskforce for developing procedures for assigng reproducibility
‘badges’ to SIGIR publications. The SIGIR community relies heavily
on experimentation and therefore it is of utmost importance that
we design and conduct experiments properly and report on the
results so that researchers’ efforts will add up.
One concern regarding the experimental practices in IR is the misuse and misinterpretation of statistical significance tests (e.g. [8, 12]).
To name but a few examples: if a researcher evaluated four search
engines and is interested in the difference between every system

FORMAT AND SCHEDULE

As this is titled “an easy hands-on tutorial,” participants are strongly
encouraged to bring their own laptop. R (with packages tidyr and
pwr) should be installed to it in advance. If a Linux environment
is available, it would be even better, for trying out the Discpower
tool (see below).
Schedule:
• Part I (60 minutes)
– Preliminaries
– Paired and two-sample t-tests, confidence intervals
– One-way ANOVA and two-way ANOVA without replication
– Familiwise error rate
• Coffee Break
• Part II (90 minutes)
– Tukey’s HSD test, simultaneous confidence intervals
– Randomisation test and randomised Tukey HSD test
– What’s wrong with statistical significance tests?

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
I thank Professor Yasushi Nagata (Waseda University) for teaching
me about sample size design [6], which I applied to topic set size
design. I also thank Professor Hideki Toyoda (Waseda University)
who kindly let me modify his R code for power analysis [13] and
distribute it.
