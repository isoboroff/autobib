to the total number of documents in the collection. This reveals
rare subtopics in an approach that is similar to the calculation of
Inverse Document Frequency [7].

ABSTRACT
A user with a standing need for updates on current events uses
a structured exploration process for finding and reviewing new
documents, with the user comparing document information to her
mental model. To avoid missing key changes on the topic, the user
should see some documents on each of the subtopics available that
day. This research includes a system and evaluation approach for
this standing need use case.

OVERVIEW

The user in our scenario has a standing information need on a
specific news topic. She needs a system that displays the most
current, highly relevant documents on diverse aspects of the given
topic, going beyond commonly discussed themes. To detect changes,
she compares documents to her internal mental model, which is
her interpretation of the world using concepts and relationships [4].
We can think about this user behavior as a session search taking
place over the course of days, weeks, or longer [1]. The user issues
an initial query, then selects and reads documents from the result
set. She may keep or reformulate the query terms and re-run the
search later to see a different result set. We postulate that this user
is interested in seeing representative documents from all subtopics,
and may not need to view every document within a subtopic.

EVALUATION

We will adapt existing diversity-related evaluation measures, such
as α-nDCG [3], the Intent Aware variant of Expected Reciprocal
Rank (ERR-IA) [2], and the Cube Test (CT) [5], to compare whether
different result sets meet the change detection need of the user.
We focus on five evaluation characteristics: Diversity, rewarding
result sets that maximize subtopic coverage; Differential Importance, providing higher scores for important subtopics; Graded
Relevance, giving higher scores to documents with higher relevance judgments; Discounting, in which the presence of multiple
documents on a single subtopic has diminishing effect on the evaluation score; and Performance Over Time, providing higher scores
for improving subtopic ordering on subsequent days.

RESEARCH QUESTIONS

We are focused on four research questions. First, how should we
operationalize recency? We will perform an experiment to compare what sort order best enables completion of a change detection
task: chronological, or a ranked list that gives higher weight to
more recent documents. Next, what would be an effective approach for dividing the result set into subtopics? We want to
produce subtopic groupings that are meaningful to the user, and
that can be compared with prior results over time. Third, how
can we improve subtopic importance over our baseline approach? Our current method highlights rare subtopics. Finally,
how can existing evaluation measures be extended to meet
the needs defined in this scenario?

SYSTEM DESIGN

Our system focuses on relevant documents received since the last
time the user accessed the system. Documents in the result set are
divided into subtopics. The system presents documents to the user
in subtopic groups, with more important subtopics appearing first.
Documents are sorted by recency within a subtopic. In the user’s
first visit to the system, we apply a basic subtopic importance calculation. Using signals provided by the user, the system will learn
what subtopics are of greatest interest to the user and re-sort accordingly. We expand upon existing work on calculating the importance
of subtopics [6, 8]. We compute an initial subtopic importance score
by comparing the total number of relevant documents in a subtopic
