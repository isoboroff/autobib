ABSTRACT
With the rapid growth of mobile web search, it is necessary and
important to understand user’s examination behavior on mobile
devices in the absence of clicks. Previous studies used viewport
metrics to estimate user’s attention. However, there still lacks an
in-depth understanding of how search users examine and interact with the mobile SERP. In this work, based on the large-scale
real search log collected from a popular commercial mobile search
engine, we present a comprehensive analysis of examination behavior. Specifically, we analyze the position bias, the relationship
with click behavior, and examination’s change as the session continues. The findings shed new light on the understanding of user’s
examination behavior, and also provide some implication for the
improvement and evaluation of mobile search engine.

INTRODUCTION

Understanding user’s examination behavior in web search is important because it provides valuable insights on snippet attractiveness [5], result relevance [8], ranking performance, and opportunities for advertising and the design of the interaction. In desktop settings, eye-tracking is widely used as an approach to studying user
examination behavior. It provides rich details on user attention by
giving fairly accurate estimates of eye gaze positions in pixel level.
Meanwhile, some previous studies find strong eye-mouse correlations, suggesting that we may reasonably infer user attention by
tracking mouse behavior, such as moving, scrolling and hovering.
Recent years have witnessed a rapid growth of mobile web search.
According to surveys, mobile web browsing overtook desktop for
⋆

the first time in October 20161 , and in the U.S. nearly 60 percent
of searches were made on mobile devices2 . Considering mobile devices are touch enabled with small displays, user interaction behaviors on mobile devices are different from those on the desktops. For
example, touch events have different meanings from cursor events
[4]. Using touch coordinates on mobile devices as a translation of
cursor coordinates may not be reliable because users may view
SERPs without touch. Another difference is that mobile search engines often present answers or relevant information (in the form of
knowledge graph) on the SERP in response to user’s simple information needs that are popular on mobile [6]. Thus, users can be satisfied by the snippet and end the search session without the need to
click on any results (i.e. good abandonment [10]). Since clicks have
been widely used to infer result relevance and search satisfaction,
the absence of clicks makes it difficult to evaluate the quality of
both documents and search engines in the mobile environment. In
these cases, the examination is the only interaction behavior we
can use to understand search users and further make quality evaluation. Therefore, understanding user’s examination behavior on
mobile devices becomes increasingly necessary and important.
Viewport, the visible portion of a web page, has been widely
studied in mobile search. In [6], by simultaneously recording eye
gaze and viewport data, it proved that viewport is strongly correlated with user attention, indicating one can track viewport to
estimate user’s examination behavior. Therefore, many previous
studies used viewport data to understand mobile search users, such
as measuring user satisfaction [3, 6], understanding user attention
with rich ad formats [7] and detecting good abandonment [10].
However, it is still unclear how users examine SERPs on mobile
devices, e.g. How deep will users view? How long will users examine
a result? What is the relationship between click and examination?
Meanwhile, most of the previous studies carried out user studies
to collect viewport data, which are limited in scale.
In this work, with the help of a popular commercial mobile
search engine, we collect large-scale real search log, including user’s
click and viewport data. Based on the log, we provide a comprehensive analysis of user’s examination behavior on the first SERP. In
particular, we focus on the following three aspects:
• The position bias in user’s examination behavior.
• The relationship between click and examination behavior.
• The change in examination behavior as the session continues.

2 RELATED WORK
There have been some studies focus on user’s attention and the
usage of viewport data. Lagun et al. [6] first studied whether tracking the viewport on mobile phones could enable accurate measurement of user attention at scale. Through quantitative eye tracking
and viewport tracking user study, they found strong correlations
between viewport metrics and user attention. Following this work,
viewport data begin to be widely used in the study of mobile search
in the absence of clicks. Williams et al. [10] extracted a series of gesture features based on the viewport data to detect good abandonment in mobile search. Guo and Song [3] present large-analysis of
viewing behavior in mobile proactive systems based on the viewport. They identified a variety of biases may influence the viewing behavior, and demonstrated that the viewport-based metrics
are more effective compared to click-based and dwelltime-based
metrics in measuring user satisfaction with the proactive systems.
Lagun et al. [7] studied how users’ eye gaze and satisfaction are
impacted by the presence of ads and their formats and improved
accuracy of existing viewport-based gaze inference methods.
Compared to these studies, our work focuses on studying examination behavior in traditional mobile web search. Different from
most of them, our dataset is collected from real search log, rather
than controlled user studies, thus the findings can be generalized
on a large scale.

ANALYZING EXAMINATION BEHAVIOR

In this section, we present a comprehensive analysis of user’s examination behavior using collected search log. In particular, we
analyze the position bias, the relationship with click behavior, and
the examination’s change during a search session.

4.1

Examination v.s. Position Bias

The position bias has been widely studied in both desktop and mobile search. It is easy to think that results in the higher positions
have a higher probability to be examined. In this section, we compare the examination rate, the examination duration, the moving
direction and end probability by position.

DATASET

From a popular commercial mobile search engine, we collect user
interaction log recorded viewports and clicks. Viewport logging
is enabled through JavaScript inserted into every SERP shown to
the users, and the viewport data is buffered and subsequently sent
back to the server through HTTP requests. We record the position
and the size of the viewport, the bounding boxes of the search results in the viewport, as well as the viewport change events with
timestamps. All the events are listed in Table 1. Meanwhile, we also
record search results on the first SERP with click timestamps for
clicked ones. These records allow us to reconstruct examination
and click behavior of users.
We first randomly sample 10% of the daily search users during
one week in January 2018. Then, we randomly sample 1% of their
interaction log as our dataset. It contains 1,473,919 searches in total.
In this work, we only study user examination behavior on the first
SERP, so we first count the number of results on the first SERP for
each search in the dataset. As we can see in Table 2, about half
of the first SERP (45.43%) have 13 results. Therefore, we make the
analysis of these log records as representative. It is worth noting
that we also analyze interaction log with 11, 12 and 14 results on
the first SERP and obtain the consistent conclusions. To save space,
we only show the analysis for interaction log with 13 results on the
first SERP in the following sections.

Examination Rate. Similar with click through rate, we first analyze the examination rate of each position, which is defined as
the ratio of the number of results at a certain position that ever
appears in a viewport to the number of total search sessions, with
a maximum of 1. In Figure 1, we can see an obvious positional decay. The examination rate of the first position is not equal to 1. It
is because users may end the search before the web page is loaded
for some reasons (e.g. typing errors, automatic shutdown). The top
two positions have relatively close rates because the initial viewport usually contains two results. In addition, we can see a sharp
decay between the last two positions. We believe this may be due to
the special vertical type of the last results, which is less attractive
to search users. Therefore, they often scroll the SERP immediately
as soon as they see these vertical results.
Examination Duration. Using the viewport change events with
timestamps, we can get the examination duration of each viewport.
Following Lagun et al.’s work [6], we then calculate weighted duration on each result based on its exposure and coverage, where
exposure is defined as how much of the result area was visible to a
user and coverage is defined as how much of the viewport real estate did the result occupy. The examination duration of each result
is computed as the sum of weighted duration across all viewports.
Through the statistical analysis, 90% of the examination durations
are no more than 12.5 seconds. To avoid statistical bias, we set a
time threshold of 30 seconds, which is longer than 95% of the durations, and correct the abnormal durations (exceed the threshold)
to 30 seconds. Similarly, we can see a positional decay of examination duration in Figure 1. In contrast to examination rate, the
difference between the top two positions is much larger, suggesting users tend to examine first result more in the initial viewport.

Due to the special vertical type, the examination duration is also
very short (about 28ms).
Moving Direction. We now investigate how the examination moves.
When finishing the examination of a viewport, users can swipe up,
swipe down or end the search session, and the viewport will move
with it. These actions can reflect users’ different states, such as
dissatisfied or need to revisit previous results. Figure 2 shows the
probabilities of three moving directions at each position. The Up
probability of 0.13 at position 4 means 13% of the viewports containing the result at position 4 will move up. From the figure, We
can get some interesting findings. First, both the End probabilities
and the Down probabilities of top two positions are about 50%, indicating in nearly half of the sessions, users only examine the initial
viewport. The End probabilities of the bottom two results indicate
that users have more than 60% tendency to end the search when
they examine the last few results. The Down probabilities of the
middle results (at position 4-8) are high, and almost the same. It
means that if a user does not end the search after examining the
top results, he or she will have a high probability of constantly examining the following results. The Up probabilities are very low
except bottom results, indicating the revisit behavior is quite few
in mobile search.
End Position. We also investigate where users end examination
behavior. Figure 3 shows the probability of the results at each position appear in the last viewport. We can see a similar result with
examination rate. However, the probabilities of the bottom half of
the positions are almost the same (except the last one, i.e. position
6-11), which can also be seen in examination duration (Figure 1),
suggesting that users are not sensitive to the result’s position in
the bottom half of the SERP.

Examination v.s. Click

According to Examination Hypothesis [9], a user will click on a result when he or she has examined it and consider it as relevant. In
this section, we try to give the relationship between examination
and click by analyzing the click behavior in the viewport.
Examination Duration. We first compare the examination durations between viewports with or without clicks. The examination
durations of viewports with clicks (median 4.0s, IQR 2.0-11.2s) are
longer than those without clicks (median 1.6s, IQR 0.8-3.8s) in general. Figure 4 shows that users tend to examine the clicked results
longer at each position. And on average, the examination duration
at each position (except position 12) is longer than 2.5 seconds. Similarly, the position bias for clicked results’ examination duration is
not obvious in the bottom half of the SERP.
Click Time. To better understand how long users need to examine a result that may be clicked on, we calculate the time between
the beginning of the viewport and click event. From Figure 5, we
can see nearly 80% of the time is between 0-5 seconds, suggesting
that 5 seconds is basically enough for a user to examine a result.
Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that if a user examines a result
nearly 5 seconds, he or she may have a high probability to click the
result, or the snippet already provides enough information, which
may lead to a good abandonment.
Click Position. In [6], the authors found that about 70% of users’
attention is focused on the top half of the screen, with little attention paid to the bottom 1/3 portion. Here, using the click position in
the viewport, we can roughly estimate the position of users’ attention. We first normalize the visible height of the result list in each
viewport to 100 grids. For each clicked result, we get the occupied
grids by its bounding box in the viewport, and increase the number
of clicks on these grids by one. Then, using all the clicked results,
we can get the click through rate of each grid. As the heatmap in
Figure 6 shows, users tend to click results in the top 2/3 portion of
the visible result list. This can also roughly indicate user’s examination position, and is consistent with the findings in [6].

Figure 8: The distribution of viewport’s examination duration over time
get longer examination duration, and these results usually appear
in the top 2/3 portion of the viewport. The examination duration
decrease with the increase of both user’s benefit or cost.
Our findings not only enriches the understanding of the examination behavior, but also provide some implications for the improvement and evaluation of mobile search engine. For example,
we find that users tend to either end the search with top few results or constantly scroll down to the end, and the position bias
is not obvious in the bottom half of the SERP. It suggests that we
should design better evaluation metrics in the mobile environment,
which consider different position bias in the different part of the
SERP. The findings in Sec 4.2 suggest that 5 seconds may be an acceptable threshold to identify good abandonment. Meanwhile, we
can also try to regard it as a click when design click models specifically for mobile search to deal with the sparse of clicks.

Users’ benefit and cost are associated with their interactions [1],
and are constantly changing with the search session. In this section, we investigate examination’s change with these two factors.
Benefit. Benefit, also referred to as gain or utility, has been discussed and introduced in a variety of ways. Based on Cascade Model
[2], which assumes a linear traversal through the ranking, and that
documents below a clicked result are not examined, we use the
first click to denote user’s benefit in the search. We compare the
examination durations before and after the first click. As Figure 7
shows, after the first click, nearly 40% of the examination durations
are within 1 seconds, and 24% are within 1-2 seconds. In contrast,
more than 50% of the examination durations are above 2 seconds
before the first click. It means that user’s examination duration decreases with the increase in user’s benefit, which can also be partly
explained by Cascade Model.
Cost. We consider temporal efforts as user’s cost and investigate
the examination duration’s change in the first 10 minutes of the
search. As the scatter plot in Figure 8 shows, the possibility of
longer examination duration begins to reduce since about 2 minutes. It indicates that user’s patience decreases over time, thus he
or she will spend less time on the later results. And this can also
explain the position bias to some extent.
