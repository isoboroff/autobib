task completion” [13]. Rather than modeling explicitly search tasks,
we strive for extending and enhancing solid strategies of semantic
search to help users achieve their tasks.
One component we focus on in this research is utilizing entity
type information, to gain a better understanding of how entity
type information can be exploited in entity retrieval [7, 9]. The
second component is concerned with understanding query intents.
Specifically, understanding what entity-oriented queries ask for,
and how they can be fulfilled [8]. The third component is about
generating query suggestions to support task-based search [4, 6]. The
search goal, often complex and knowledge-intensive, may lead the
user to issue multiple queries to eventually complete her underlying
task. We envisage the capability of the three identified components
to complement each other for supporting task completion.

ABSTRACT
Web search is a human experience of a very rapid and impactful
evolution. It has become a key technology on which people rely
daily for getting information about almost everything. This evolution of the search experience has also shaped the expectations
of people about it. The user sees the search engine as a wise interpreter capable of understanding the intent and meaning behind a
search query, realizing her current context, and responding to it directly and appropriately [1]. Search by meaning, or semantic search,
rather than just literal matches, became possible by a large portion
of IR research devoted to study semantically more meaningful representations of the information need expressed by the user query.
Major commercial search engines have indeed responded to user
expectations, capitalizing on query semantics, or query understanding. They introduced features which not only provide information
directly but also engage the user to stay interacting in the search
engine result page (SERP). Direct displays (weather, flight offers,
exchange rates, etc.), rich vertical content (images, videos, news,
etc.), and knowledge panels, are examples of this recent evolution
trend into answer engines [10].
Our notion of semantics is inherently based on the one of structure. Given the large portion of web search queries looking for
entities [11], entities and their properties—attributes, types, and
relationships—are first-class citizens in our space of structured
knowledge. Semantic search can then be seen as a rich toolbox.
Multiple techniques recognize these essential knowledge units in
queries, identify them uniquely in underlying knowledge repositories, and exploit them to address a particular aspect of query
understanding [2]. Query recommendations are another remarkable approach, whose suggestion feedback points to provide hints
for improving the articulation of the search query.
This research focuses on utilizing techniques from semantic
search in the next evolution stage of search engines, namely, the
support for task completion. Search is usually performed with a specific goal underlying the query. This goal, in many cases, consists
in a nontrivial task to be completed. Indeed, task-based search corresponds to a considerable portion of query volume [5]. Addressing
task-based search can have a large impact on search behavior [3],
yet the interaction processes behind performing a complex task are
very far to be fully understood [12]. Current search engines allow to
solve a small set of basic tasks, and most of the knowledge-intensive
workload for supporting more complex tasks is on the user. The
ultimate challenge is then to build useful systems “to achieve work
