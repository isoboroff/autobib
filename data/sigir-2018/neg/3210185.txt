now prefer to spend more time shopping online. E-commerce corporations, e.g., Amazon, Alibaba, and JD.com, are amassing billions
of user requests per day. As part of this process, large volumes
of multi-modal data, including user search logs, clicks, orders, reviews, images, and chat logs, etc., are being generated. From an
information retrieval point of view, discovering and employing
appropriate information from the sheer volume of e-commerce
data to enhance performances of e-commerce products presents
interesting challenges for both academic and industrial researchers.
Information discovery in e-commerce can be divided into five
main directions:

EXTENDED ABSTRACT
E-commerce (electronic commerce or EC) is the buying and selling
of goods and services, or the transmitting of funds or data online. Ecommerce platforms come in many kinds, with global players such
as Amazon, Airbnb, Alibaba, eBay, JD.com and platforms targeting
specific markets such as Bol.com and Booking.com.
Information retrieval has a natural role to play in e-commerce,
especially in connecting people to goods and services. Information discovery in e-commerce concerns different types of search
(exploratory search vs. lookup tasks), recommender systems, and
natural language processing in e-commerce portals. Recently, the
explosive popularity of e-commerce sites has made research on
information discovery in e-commerce more important and more
popular. There is increased attention for e-commerce information
discovery methods in the community as witnessed by an increase
in publications and dedicated workshops in this space. Methods for
information discovery in e-commerce largely focus on improving
the performance of e-commerce search and recommender systems,
on enriching and using knowledge graphs to support e-commerce,
and on developing innovative question-answering and bot-based
solutions that help to connect people to goods and services.
Below we describe why we believe that the time is right for an
introductory tutorial on information discovery in e-commerce, the
objectives of the proposed tutorial, its relevance, as well as more
practical details, such as the format, schedule and support materials.

e-commerce user behavior modeling and profiling
content analysis of e-commerce text,
e-commerce search and ranking,
e-commerce recommender systems, and
e-commerce conversational interaction systems.

Each of these areas comes with its own set of research challenges.
For example, in e-commerce search there may be no hypertext
links between products; there is a click stream, but there is also
an order stream. E-commerce information discovery problems are
wide in scope and range from user interaction modalities. There is a
growing body of established methods for information discovery in
e-commerce (see the schedule below for a broad range of examples).
Most of them are aimed at developing algorithms about product
search in e-commerce [1, 10], candidate retrieval in e-commerce [15,
50], user behavior analysis [52, 59], recommender systems [14, 21,
35, 37, 46], content analysis, and conversational interactions [4, 11,
18, 22, 29, 29, 39]. These areas, and the methods developed, form
the core around which most ongoing research efforts concerning
information discovery for e-commerce is organized.
The time is right to organize and present this material to a broad
audience of interested information retrieval researchers, whether
junior or senior, whether academic or industrial. One of the key
aims of the proposed tutorial is to bring together, and offer a unified perspective on, the large number of methods for e-commerce
information discovery that are available today. To achieve this,
we describe the basic architecture about information discovery in
e-commerce, algorithms for e-commerce information discovery,
and evaluation principles. We supplement this with an account of
available datasets and packages based on these. We also present
e-commerce applications accompanied by examples.
We expect the tutorial to be useful for both academic and industrial researchers who either want to develop e-commerce information discovery methods, use them in their own research, or

apply the methods described in the tutorial to improve product
performance in e-commerce services.

• To describe existing e-commerce information discovery algorithms in a unified way, i.e., using common notation and terminology, so that different models can easily be related to each
other.
• To explain the importance of balancing exploration and exploitation in information discovery in an e-commerce setting.
• To explain how to analyze the performance of e-commerce information discovery algorithms and why it is worth the effort.
• To present appropriate experimental and evaluation methodologies for e-commerce information discovery in both synthetic
and real world settings.
• To describe how to deploy e-commerce information discovery
algorithms in an industrial setting.
• To discuss future directions of research in e-commerce information discovery.

OBJECTIVES

Information discovery plays a role in many areas, ranging from
web search to academic search and medical search. What is different about the e-commerce setting is that the traditional web-page
ranking features are either not present or are present in a different form [9]; instead, discovery processes need to be supported
based on unstructured information, structured information, semistructured, or information that might have facets such as price,
ratings, title, description, seller location, and so on.
Our treatment information discovery in e-commerce is organized
in four groups. The first group concerns two main areas: (1) modeling user behavior and user profiling, and (2) content analysis
in an e-commerce setting: from text, OCR files, and item images
material; multiple content analysis tasks are addressed to enhance
e-commerce services, e.g., review filtering. This group of topics and
techniques prepares us for the next three groups.
Then, the second group of topics that make up this tutorial
concerns e-commerce search. Just like, e.g., traditional web search,
the target of this task is to satisfy users’ needs. However, product
search in e-commerce sites should be achieved with new types
of features, and the concept of relevance can be highly personal
in product search. And, as pointed out above, the target corpora
can structured, semi-structured, or unstructured; semantic search
against diverse sources raises interesting research challenges.
The third group of topics covered in this tutorial concerns ecommerce recommendations. In contrast to traditional research
on recommender systems that focuses on rating prediction, ecommerce recommender systems usually aim to optimize the top-N
online recommendation results based on implicit feedback. Due
to the existence of a very large number of candidate items in ecommerce portals, of which only a small fraction attracts users’
attention, personalized e-commerce recommendation procedure
usually consist of two procedures. The first is to generate candidate
items. The second is to rank candidate items. Given structured user
behavior logs and semi-structured data about product features, ecommerce knowledge-bases can be created to assist the candidate
generation step. And the candidate ranking procedure ranks the retrieved candidate items for a better conversion rate or click-through
rate, based on various machine learning models [6, 13–15].
The fourth group of topics direction of this tutorial concerns
conversational interaction systems in e-commerce. Conversational
interaction helps various e-commerce applications, e.g., customer
service, to interact with humans in an intelligent natural way. The
target of conversational interaction systems is to generate proper
utterances given previous utterances, which raises research challenges for both task-oriented and non-task-oriented scenarios.

Topics not covered as part of the tutorial

E-commerce impacts large parts of our economy and society, including markets and retailers, supply chain management, employment.
While all of these are important, scientifically challenging, and
deserving of attention from the information retrieval community,
in the proposed tutorial we will restrict ourselves to information
discovery in the context of e-commerce. In particular, we will not
cover computational advertizing, marketing strategies or information mangement in e-commerce.

FORMAT AND DETAILED SCHEDULE

The tutorial is organized into four parts, each mixing theoretical
principles and experimental outcomes, with formal analyses of
e-commerce information discovery methods interleaved with discussions of experimental outcomes. In Part I we aim at providing
preliminaries of e-commerce information discovery, including user
behavior modeling, profiling, and content analysis in e-commerce.
Part II is aimed at e-commerce search and ranking and deals with
the key concepts and algorithms. In Part III we focus on the recommender systems for e-commerce, and select a small number
of topics for which we provide a more in-depth technical treatment. In Part IV we discuss conversational interaction systems in
e-commerce portals.

models (e.g., XGBoost, etc.) [6, 48], and neural network recommendation models (e.g., wide and deep neural networks) [7]. We
also demonstrate online performance of real-world e-commerce
recommender systems based on these models.
• We describe state-of-the-art neural network based recommendation models, e.g., neural collaborative filtering [15] and neural
factorization machines [12], etc. We also introduce approaches
that address effectiveness and efficiency (e.g., eALS) [14], and
multi-modal recommendation models [5, 49].
• We introduce recent work based on bandits and reinforcement
learning models for online recommendation [38, 44].

39, 42, 53, 54], especially for those research on knowledge-based
question-answering and non-factoid question-answering systems. Thereafter, we discuss how to employ those models to
e-commerce services.

Part III: Recommendation

[10min] Introduction, aims and historical notes about e-commerce
recommendation

algorithms and models for e-commerce recommendation.
[25min] Candidate product retrieval in e-commerce
• Candidate product retrieval refers to a process that retrieves
personalized candidates out of billions of items, which provides
relevant products for e-commerce search and e-commerce recommendation. We describe several strategies for retrieving personalized product candidates, especially for distinguishing substitutable and complementary products [50, 57].
• We describe how to employ network embeddings to generate
relevant product pairs or relevant communities to enhance the
performance of e-commerce candidate retrieval. We start with
traditional network embeddings, such as Deepwalk [30] and
LINES [41], and arrive at state-of-the-art work on multi-dimension
network embeddings [27] and heterogeneous embeddings [2, 32,
45].

24].
• Task-oriented dialog systems has gained an increase of attention.
We introduce recent work on task-oriented dialog systems [3, 8,
26, 31], and discuss how to employ those models to e-commerce
custom service chatbots or dialog-based online recommender
systems.
