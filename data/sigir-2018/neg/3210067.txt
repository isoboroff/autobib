recent researches on ontology construction [8], much less progress
has been made with regard to ontology evaluation. As a result,
there are few commonly agreed-upon methodologies and metrics
for evaluating ontology complexity.
The entropy can quantify the amount of lexical information
included in the ontology. In this regard, each ontology can be considered as a graph or a network, the entropy rate of which is a
measure of the complexity of the graph [12]. The information density is operationalized based on the normalized entropy measured
between all concept pairs in the ontology. A higher entropy value
signifies a higher redundant ontology. Current entropy applications
used to evaluate ontology have three limitations, in that they
• Exclusively consider single point connectivity rather
than paths [5]: An ontology is an undirected graph with
edges that connect unordered pairs of vertices. Connectivity
that depends directly on single point connectivity neglects
information pertaining to non-adjacent nodes and is, thus,
considered the weakest means of measuring network connectivity.
• Assign equal weights to edges and paths [1]: The equal
weights assignment is unrealistic and can induce a loss of
diversity. Considering a node in a graph with several paths of
equal weight will result in an incorrect path search, because
the lack of path differences leaves each other path with no
probability mass.
• Assume vertices are static: Ontologies are wildly used to
real-world applications, in where vertexes usually attach
more than one meaning and hence demonstrate various aspects when interacting with different neighboring vertices
[2]. For instance, in the field of medicine, it is necessary
to consider vertices as dynamic, because interactions and
weights between nodes vary greatly among different diagnosis and treatment scenarios.
To address these three limitations, the present study describes a
Path-based Text-aware Entropy Computation method (PTEC) by
comparing its information densities to those of other ontologies. To
this end, we utilize path information between different vertices in
the ontology and textual information included in the path to calculate different weights between various nodes and the connectivity
path of the entire network. Specifically, we apply CNN to learn two
types of embeddings for a vertex: structure-based embedding and
text-based embedding. Given a vertex u and its neighboring vertex
v, the embedding of u differs with different neighbors; and, when
u interacts with v, the embeddings of u and v are derived from
each vertex’s textual information, respectively. Subsequently, the

ABSTRACT
With the rising importance of knowledge exchange, ontologies have
become a key technology in the development of shared knowledge
models for semantic-driven applications, such as knowledge interchange and semantic integration. Significant progress has been
made in the use of entropy to measure the predictability and redundancy of knowledge bases, particularly ontologies. However, the
current entropy applications used to evaluate ontologies consider
only single-point connectivity rather than path connectivity, assign
equal weights to each entity and path, and assume that vertices are
static. To address these deficiencies, the present study proposes a
Path-based Text-aware Entropy Computation method, PTEC, by
considering the path information between different vertices and the
textual information within the path to calculate the connectivity
path of the whole network and the different weights between various nodes. Information obtained from structure-based embedding
and text-based embedding is multiplied by the connectivity matrix
of the entropy computation. An experimental evaluation of three
real-world ontologies is performed based on ontology statistical
information (data quantity), entropy evaluation (data quality), and a
case study (ontology structure and text visualization). These aspects
mutually demonstrate the reliability of our method. Experimental
results demonstrate that PTEC can effectively evaluate ontologies,
particularly those in the medical field.

information gain, which is in the form of a matrix obtained by a
cosine similarity calculation of the relevancy between nodes u and
v, is multiplied by the connectivity matrix of entropy computations.
Because ontological redundancy is mainly manifested in loose
structures and lengthy textual information, we experimentally evaluated three infectious disease-relevant ontologies. The ontology
statistical information and textual attention visualization is used as
a reference to evaluate the validity of the calculation.
This paper makes several novel contributions. (1) We evaluate an
ontology by adjusting the connectivity matrix of entropy computations in consideration of both path information and text information
within neural network architectures, overcoming the limitations
of single point connectivity and the equal weighting problem. (2)
To solve the unrealistic assumption of traditional ontology computations, in which each vertex is represented as a static embedding
vector, we consider diverse interactions between nodes by adapting
mutual attention to emphasize those words that are focused by its
neighbor vertices. (3) Based on experiments utilizing real-world ontologies, the method proposed herein achieves better performance
than existing methods in evaluating ontologies.

path and text information into same representation space. Then we
concatenate structure-based and text-based embeddings as vertices
embeddings. Finally, the connectivity matrix of entropy computation is adjusted using the information gain obtained by the vertices
embeddings.

We encode graph structure information by maximizing the loglikelihood of all directed edges. The structure-based energy function
is computed as:
Ls (e) = log p(v s |u s ).

As with Node2vec, we calculate conditional probability of vertices v generated by vertices u as:
exp(u s · v s )
p(v s |u s ) = Í

Text-based Embeddings

Given the word sequence of a vertex, a CNN is adopted to capture
the text information included in the ontology.
Input representation: We use distributed word representation
and transform sentence S = {w 1 , w 2 , . . . , w n } into corresponding
word embedding sequence W = {w 1 , w 2 , ... , w n } as input of CNN,
where w i ∈ Rd , d is dimension of the word embeddings.
Convolution: For connected edge eu,v with vertices u and v,
we perform convolution operation over a sliding window to extract
local features of their textual embeddings Wu and Wv , where Wu
∈ R(d∗m) , Wv ∈ R(d∗n) , m and n represents the lengths of Wu and
Wv respectively.
Attentive Pooling: To encode the vertices interactive information facing different neighbors, we apply mutual attention into
the pooling layer. To be specific, based on the output of convolution layer U and V respectively for vertice u and v, we introduce
an attentive matrix A ∈ R(d∗d) and calculate the correlation matrix C ∈ R(m∗n) , which represents the pair-wise correlation score
between U and V, as follow:
C = tanh(UT AV).

RELATED WORK

Although some evaluation methods and metrics have been suggested [4, 14], few empirical studies have focused on ontology
evaluation [4]. Most existing metrics have been proposed to evaluate the syntactical, semantic, and structural features of ontological
conceptual models [6]. Few metrics have been used to investigate
ontological complexity, information density and redundancy.
Several studies have attempted to use entropy-based methods
to measure ontological concept similarities [7] and design complexity [15]. However, these studies exclusively use entropy with
edge information and node name and do not consider textual information or connections between paths. Network embedding (NE)
models, including DeepWalk, LINE, and node2vec, have been proposed to determine efficient vertex embeddings. Nevertheless, these
structure-only models do not consider all information pertaining
to the vertices in networks. Many studies have tried to incorporate information into NE models or convolutional neural networks.
Yang et al. [13] adopted a text-associated DeepWalk model to incorporate the textual features of vertices into network representation
learning using a matrix factorization framework. Sun et al. [10]
utilized content-enhanced network embedding to jointly leverage
network structure and content information. Tu et al. [11] proposed
a max-margin DeepWalk to improve the model’s discriminatory
ability. Most network embedding methods rely solely on each networkÂąÂŕs structure and ignore the diversity of vertex interactions,
yet it is clear that the rich network content information that characterizes each node is important to entropy evaluations.

Structure-based Embeddings

Intuitively, the attentive matrix is used to assign different weights
according to the specific role each vertex plays when interacting
with other vertices. Then we conduct mean pooling operations
along the rows and columns of C to generate the row-pooling and
column-pooling respectively:
hui = mean(Ci,1 , . . . , Ci,n ), hvi = mean(C 1,i , . . . , Cm,i ). (4)
where hui and hvi indicates importance score for word i when
interacting with vertice v and u respectively. Next we obtain atu ]T and hv =
tention vectors au and av from hu = [hu1 , . . . , hm
v
v
T
[h 1 , . . . , hn ] by employing softmax function.
Finally, the text-based embeddings of u and v are calculated as:

= U au , v (u)
= V av .

METHODOLOGY

This study proposes an entropy evaluation method that utilizes information divergence by considering both text-based and structurebased embeddings. Specifically, we first learn structure-based embeddings via a similar fashion with Node2vec, and learn the textbased embeddings via a CNN model with mutual attention [3],
meanwhile, we conduct the optimization jointly to encode both

softmax computation as structure-based as Eq. (1).

Weighted Connectivity Matrix

Entropy can be calculated via the network probability distribution
function. Its connectivity matrix Cuv includes the vertices connection information, and is dedicated to calculating node probabilities.
Given the structure-based and text-based embedding concatenation results, the relevancy between nodes u and v is evaluated
using a cosine similarity measure. When nodes u and v are not
directly connected, the selected path is their shortest path. To avoid
multiple calculations of the same path’s weight, the relevancy is
divided by the shortest path, the result of which is considered to be
the information gain and represented as Ouv .
We multiply Ouv by the connectivity matrix Cuv of the entropy
computation. The probabilities Pk of each concept k can be processed by Eq. (8):

classes with no text description matching from Wikipedia, we have
built the lineage of classes by performing a bottom-up extraction
that copies text descriptions from their superclass nodes. For a DO
class that has neither text description nor superclass description,
the label is adopted as the text description.

According to the statistical information from IDO, IDODEN and
DO, the number of triplets and classes increases while the number
of relations decreases, resulting in decrease of granularity.
Ontology visualization is realized by the network embedding
projector (t-SNE). IDO ontology is constituted by 51 type of colors
which indicate the connected components, while The IDODEN
and IDDAP ontology, although with complicated structure, is only
composed by 27 and 19 type of colors respectively (see Fig. 1). IDO
exhibits the lowest redundancy, based on its simple structure and
clear node definition.

4.1 Datasets
We evaluate our method using the following three real-world network datasets: Infectious Disease Ontology 1 (IDO), Dengue ontology 2 (IDODEN) and Disease Ontology 3 (DO). The IDO is considered
the most complete infectious disease ontology, while the IDODEN
is an extension of the IDO for dengue fever and contains a wide
spectrum of ontological descriptions. The DO represents a comprehensive knowledge base of 8,043 inherited, developmental and
acquired human diseases.
4.1.1 Data preprocessing. To conduct text embedding, the class
definition in ontology is considered the text description. For a DO
that has no property or other text description, class labels are used
as literal queries to extract no more than 5 sentences from the
Wikipedia terminology introduction as the text description. For

Implementation Details

We apply a grid search to the dimensions of word/structure embeddings among {50, 100, 150} and set optimal as 100. For optimization,
we use an Adam optimizer and set the learning rate as 0.001, and
negative sampling for computation efficiency as the softmax computation in conditional probability Eq.(5) is expensive, in where the
number of negative samples k is set as 1. Because the path weights
to be calculated are based predominantly on structure embedding

Results

4.3.1 Entropy evaluation. The entropy value obtained by PTEC
is lower than that by the unimproved entropy method (Table 2). The
consideration of textual information effectively adjusts the network
information density and affects the value of redundancy.
Pearson correlation coefficient and Spearman rank correlation
coefficient are adopted to evaluate the PTEC performance. The IDO
ontology, which is a well-recognized formal ontology for human
infectious disease, is used as the base for calculating these coefficients. IDODEN and DO are compared with IDO in three aspects:
number of triples, number of classes and entities, and number of
relations. Comparison results, utilizing three scores ranging from 0
to 1, have been obtained using the softmax normalization method.
To reduce bias, we consider the average of these three scores as
the final score. The geometric mean is employed to calculate the
average, that is, the greater the difference, the smaller the mean.

4.3.2 Impact of textual Information. To analyze the effectiveness of textual information, we also report ablation test results in
terms of discarding textual information (w/o text). As shown in
Table 3, the experimental results are in accordance with ontology
visualization. The correlation coefficients indicate that the PTEC
results strongly correlate with the ontology statistical information.
Comparison with baselines reveals that, regarding semantic web
analytics and assessments, both structure information and text
information are important and require simultaneous consideration.
We have randomly chosen one type of disease (dengue virus
maturation) as well as its causal and inheritance relations from
IDODEN and visualize the attention scores of textual information
predicted by PTEC in Fig. 2.
The information gain between word pairs (dengue virus maturation, virus maturation) and (dengue virus maturation, dengue
virion) is 6.7545 and 2.2228 respectively. Consistently, the higher
the information gain is, the more information the attention model
highlights. This result demonstrates that, when the same ontology structure is considered, differences in the text information
contained in nodes will lead to differences in ontology redundancy.
