ABSTRACT

In this paper, we revisit this assumption and hypothesize that
there might be an interdependence relationship between different
axioms. As a preliminary study, we focus on analyzing the pseudorelevance feedback (PRF) models. PRF is a well-known strategy to
address the vocabulary mismatch problem in information retrieval
(IR). PRF assumes that the top retrieved documents in response to
an initial query are relevant to the query and uses these documents
for estimating a more accurate query model. Previous works have
shown that PRF models can benefit from axiomatic analysis. For
instance, Clinchant and Gaussier [4] proposed five constraints for
PRF models and showed that even state-of-the-art PRF models do
not satisfy all of the constraints. Following their work, a number
of other constraints have been proposed and several modifications
have been suggested for PRF models, e.g., see [2, 8–10].
In this paper, we propose two interdependent constraints. The
first constraint takes the interdependence relationship of the term
frequency (TF) and the inverse document frequency (IDF) into account. “TF effect” and “IDF effect”, that are two existing constraints
respectively corresponding to TF and IDF, have been previously
considered independently [4]. Our first constraint shows the effect
of IDF on the TF constraint. With a similar idea, our second constraint focuses on the relationship between term frequency and
document relevance scores. In fact, this constraint indicates that the
influence of term frequency on the feedback weight should depend
on the relevance score of the documents containing the term.
Furthermore, we study two state-of-the-art PRF models, the loglogistic feedback model [3] and the relevance model [7], and modify
these two models in order to satisfy the proposed interdependent
constraints. The empirical evaluation on three TREC collections
demonstrates the effectiveness of each of the proposed constraints.
Our modifications to the log-logistic and relevance models lead to
significant improvements in all collections. We believe that, our
findings open up a new research direction by considering the interdependence relationship between constraints when studying IR
models in different tasks.

Axiomatic analysis is a well-defined theoretical framework for analytical evaluation of information retrieval models. The current
studies in axiomatic analysis implicitly assume that the constraints
(axioms) are independent. In this paper, we revisit this assumption
and hypothesize that there might be interdependence relationships
between the existing constraints. As a preliminary study, we focus
on the pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) models that have been
theoretically studied using the axiomatic analysis approach. In
this paper, we introduce two novel interdependent PRF constraints
which emphasize on the effect of existing constraints on each other.
We further modify two state-of-the-art PRF models, log-logistic
and relevance models, in order to satisfy the proposed constraints.
Experiments on three TREC newswire and web collections demonstrate that the proposed modifications significantly outperform the
baselines, in all cases.

INTRODUCTION

Many information retrieval (IR) models consist of heuristic components and/or make several simplifying assumptions that are not
necessarily correct. Axiomatic analysis [1, 6, 11] provides a welldefined theoretic structure in order to study IR models analytically,
which often lead to empirical improvements. In the axiomatic analysis framework, a number of constraints, also called axioms, are
defined and IR models are designed or modified to satisfy these
constraints. Previous work on axiomatic analysis literature assumes
that axioms are independent of each other, and thus the models are
studied given each axiom, separately.
A part of this work was done while Ali Montazeralghaem was a Master student at the
University of Tehran.

METHODOLOGY

Several theoretic constraints have been proposed for pseudo-relevance feedback. Previous work [4, 8, 10] demonstrated that satisfying
these constraints leads to significant improvements in retrieval
performance. In this section, we propose two novel constraints for
PRF models, which focus on the interdependence of the existing
constraints. In the following subsections, we first propose two
interdependent constraints and further modify two state-of-the-art
PRF models in order to satisfy the proposed constraints.

Notation. Let FW (w; F , Pw , q) be a real-valued feedback weight
function that assigns a weight to each candidate term w for a given
query q. F and Pw denote the set of feedback documents for the
query q and a set of term-dependent parameters, respectively. Let
RS(d, q) denote the relevance score of document d to query q and
SRS(w, F ) denote the sum of relevance scores of the feedback documents containing the term w. For simplicity, we use FW (w), RS(d)
and SRS(w), hereafter. In the following equations, t f (w, d) and
id f (w), respectively denote term frequency and inverse document
frequency. The notation | · | represents the length of the given
query/document or the size of the given set.

2.1

2.2

d ∈F

Interdependent Constraints

d ∈F

where RS denotes the relevance score function. We focus on this
model since it significantly outperforms the original log-logistic
model [8]. This model satisfies “TF-IDF effect” because:

(1)

avд

log(1 + c |d | l )
∂ 2 FWLLR (w)
= 1
> 0 (5)
avдl
2
∂t f (w, d).∂id f (w) (
λw log(1 + c |d | )t f (w, d) + 1)
Although this approach satisfies the first proposed constraint,
there is only a light interdependence relationship between t f and
id f . In other words, the derivative of the LLR weight function with
respect to t f (w, d), which is given as follows, does not have a strong
dependence to id f :

Formally writing, for all candidate feedback terms w, the following
constraints should be satisfied:
∂ 2 FW (w)
>0
∂t f (w, d).∂id f (w)
The intuition behind this constraint is that increasing the term
frequency of common terms (low id f ) should have less impact
on the feedback weight, compared to the rare terms (high id f ).
From the information theory perspective, if we add a rare term
to a document, we provide more information, compared to the
scenario of adding a common term. Consequently, the difference
of feedback weight between two terms caused by discrimination
value of them, should increase when these two terms are added to
the feedback document. This shows the interdependence between
term frequency and inverse document frequency that have been
considered as independent axioms in prior work [4].
[TF-SRS effect] Let w 1 and w 2 be two vocabulary terms, such
that id f (w 1 ) = id f (w 2 ) and SRS(w 1 ) > SRS(w 2 ). Let d ∈ F be a
feedback document, where t f (w 1 , d) = t f (w 2 , d) > 0. In this case,
if we add both terms to the document, i.e., t f ′ (w 1 , d) = t f ′ (w 2 , d) =
t f (w 1 , d) + 1, then we will have:
′

′

FW (w 1 ) − FW (w 2 ) > FW (w 1 ) − FW (w 2 )

d ∈F

where λw = NNw is the fraction of the documents that contain the
term w in the whole collection. Also, t(w, d) = t f (w, d) log(1 +
avд
c |d | l ) represents a term frequency function normalized by the
document length, where avдl denotes the average document length
and c is a free hyper-parameter. A modification of the log-logistic
model has been proposed recently [8], called LLR, in order to satisfy
the “relevance effect” constraint [10]:
1 Õ
FWLLR (w) =
FWLL (w, d) ∗ RS(Q, d)
(4)
|F |

In this subsection, we introduce two interdependent constraints for
pseudo-relevance feedback models.
[TF-IDF effect] Let w 1 and w 2 be two vocabulary terms, such
that id f (w 1 ) > id f (w 2 ) and SRS(w 1 ) = SRS(w 2 ). Assume that
there exists a document d ∈ F , where t f (w 1 , d) = t f (w 2 , d) > 0 and
FW (w 1 ; F \{d }) = FW (w 2 ; F \{d }). In this case, if we add both terms
to this document such that t f ′ (w 1 , d) = t f ′ (w 2 , d) = t f (w 1 , d) + 1
and FW ′ (w 1 ) and FW ′ (w 1 ) be updated weights, then we will have:
FW ′ (w 1 ) − FW ′ (w 2 ) > FW (w 1 ) − FW (w 2 )

Modifying the Log-Logistic Model

The log-logistic (LL) feedback model [3] is a state-of-the-art PRF
model that has been shown to outperform several PRF models, including the geometric relevance model [12] and the mixture model
[13]. The feedback weight function in the log-logistic model is
defined as follows:
1 Õ
t(w, d) + λw
1 Õ
FWLL (w, d) =
log(
FWLL (w) =

λ log(1 + c |d | )t f (w, d) + 1

(6)

w

As shown in the above equation, if we omit 1 from the denominator, the derivative becomes independent from id f . We believe
that increasing this derivative with respect to the id f could lead
to higher performance. To overcome this issue, we re-write this
function as follows:
1 Õ
t(w, d)A(w ) + λw
FWT F −I D F (w) =
log(
)
(7)
|F |
λw
d ∈F

where

Now the derivative of this function is:
A(w) = log(

A(w ) + 1
∂t f (w, d)
λ log(1 + c |d | )t f (w, d)

which can be formally formulated as:
∂ 2 FW (w)
>0
∂t f (w, d).∂SRS(w)

w

According to the above equation, the derivative of FWT F −I D F is
more dependent to id f , and when we omit 1 from the denominator
the derivative nearly will be A(w) that is stronger from Equation (6)
for satisfying TF-IDF constraint. Figure 1 illustrates the correlation
between id f and derivative of LLR and LLR+TF-IDF with respect
to term frequency (Equations (6) and (9)). Based on this plot, LLR
weight function has a light interdependence relationship between
t f and id f whereas LLR+TF-IDF improves it.

where w is a candidate feedback term. In other words, according
to the relevance effect constraint [2, 10], the terms appearing in
the documents with higher relevance scores should get higher
feedback weights. The TF-SRS constraint indicates that increase
in frequency of the words with higher SRS(w) values should lead
to higher feedback weights. The intuition behind this idea can be
mapped to the one proposed for the previous constraint.

LLR
It can be shown that ∂t f (w,d).∂S
RS (w ) = 0, which means that
the log-logistic models (both LL and LLR) do not satisfy the “TF-SRS
effect” constraint. Hence, we modify the weight function as follows
in order to satisfy this constraint:
t(w, d) + λw

Com(w, F ) = d ∈FÍ
d ∈F RS(d)

Figure 1: Correlation between id f and the derivative of LLR
and LLR+TF-IDF formulas with respect to T F (Eq. (6) and (9)).
To satisfy the proposed constraints, we estimate p(w |F ) as follows:
Õ
p(w |F ) ∝
RS(D) ∗ I (w, D)

(11)

where I (w, d) denotes the occurrence of term w in document d.
Hence, the modified log-logistic model is:
FWAll (w) = Com(w, F )

which shows how this term appears in the relevant documents.
p(w) can also be estimated using the document frequency of the
term in the whole collection, which indicates how common the
term is. Other computation details are the same as the original
relevance models [7].
It can be proved that the proposed modification to RM3 satisfies both TF-IDF and TF-SRS constraints as well as the IDF effect
constraint proposed in [4]. We call this model RM3+ALL.

Modifying the Relevance Model

In this subsection, we focus on RM3, a well-known and state-ofthe-art variant of the relevance models proposed by Lavrenko and
Croft [7]. The feedback weight of each term w for a given query Q
in RM3 is computed as follows:
FWRM 3 (w) = p(w |Q) =

p(w, Q)
∝ p(w, Q) = p(w, q 1 , ..., qk ) (13)
p(Q)

3 EXPERIMENTS
3.1 Collections and Experimental Setup

where qi denotes the i t h query term.
Clinchant and Gaussier [4] showed that relevance model does
not satisfy IDF effect, and this means that this model cannot satisfy
TF-IDF effect. This model also does not have any component of SRS
and therefore cannot satisfy TF-SRS effect.
We re-write this function by bringing the feedback set into the
feedback weight formula as follows:
p(w |Q, F ) ∝ p(w, Q |F ) = p(w, q 1 , ..., qk |F )
Õ
=
p(D)p(w, q 1 , ..., qk |D, F )

We used three standard TREC collections in our experiments: AP
(Associated Press 1988-89, TREC topics 51-200), Robust (TREC Robust Track 2004 collection, TREC topics 301-450 & 601-700) and
WT10g (TREC Web Track 2001-2002, TREC topics 451-550). The
first two collections are homogeneous collections containing news
articles, while the third collection is a heterogeneous collection
containing web pages. The WT10g collection is noisier than the
newswire collections.
All documents are stemmed using the Porter stemmer and stopped
using the standard INQUERY stopword list. 1
3.1.1 Parameter Setting. The number of feedback documents,
the number of feedback terms, the feedback coefficient and the
parameter c in the Log-logistic model are set using 2-fold crossvalidation over the queries of each collection. We sweeped the number of feedback documents between {10, 25, 50, 75, 100}, feedback
terms between {50, 100, · · · , 300}, the feedback coefficient between
{0, 0.1, · · · , 1}, and the parameters c between {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}.
3.1.2 Evaluation Metrics. We use mean average precision (MAP)
of the 1000 top-ranked documents as the main metric to evaluate the retrieval effectiveness. We also report the precision of the
top 10 retrieved documents (P@10). Furthermore, we consider the
robustness index (RI) [5] to evaluate the robustness of methods.
Statistically significant differences of performances are determined
using the two-tailed paired t-test computed at a 95% confidence
level over average precision per query.

The conditional independence assumption of terms leads to the

We estimate each of the conditional as follows:
p(w |D, F ) =

p(D|w, F )p(w |F )p(F )
p(D|F )p(F )

(16)

Under the assumption of independence of a feedback document
given a term from the whole feedback set, we have:
p(D|w)p(w |F )
w i ∈D p(D|w i )p(w i |F )

p(w |D, F ) = Í

where p(D|w) can be computed by Bayes rule p(D|w) =

where we consider p(D) uniform for all documents and p(w |D) is
computed using the maximum likelihood estimation: p(w |D) =
t f (w, D)

by query likelihood, (2) the original log-logistic feedback model (LL)
[3], and (3) the modified log-logistic model (LLR) [8] that satisfies
the relevance effect constraint.
To study the effect of each constraint in the retrieval performance, we modify the log-logistic model based on each constraint,
separately. Equations (7) and (10) are the feedback weight functions
that satisfy the TF-IDF and the TF-SRS constraints, respectively.
We also modify the log-logistic model by considering all of these
constraints, called LL+ALL (see Equation (12)). The results obtained
by the baselines and those achieved by the proposed modifications
are reported in Table 1. LL outperforms the NoPRF baseline in all
cases, which indicates the effectiveness of the log-logistic model and
validates the findings presented in prior work [3, 8]. Both LLR+TFIDF and LLR+TF-SRS outperform all three baselines (NoPRF, LL,
and LLR), which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed
constraints. The improvements achieved by LLR+TF-SRS is higher
than those obtained by LLR+TF-IDF. This indicates that the interdependence between t f and SRS which models the local importance
of the term is more effective than the interaction between t f and
id f which models the global importance of the term. In addition,
LLR+TF-SRS and LLR+TF-IDF are shown to be more robust than
the baselines in all the collections. LLR+TF-SRS performs more robust compared to LLR+TF-IDF, in all the collections, especially the
web collection. The MAP improvements for both LLR+TF-IDF and
LLR+TF-SRS methods are close to each other in all the collections
specially in the noisy collection (WT10g) which shows that both of
these two constraints are important for PRF methods.
LLR+All that satisfies both constraints outperforms the baselines.
These improvements are statistically significant in all cases.
3.2.2 Evaluating the Modified Relevance Model. In this set of
experiments, we consider two baselines: (1) the document retrieval
method without feedback (NoPRF) computed by query likelihood,
and (2) the RM3 method [7]. Since the proposed approach satisfies both constraints simultaneously (we do not propose different
solutions for satisfying different axioms), we only report the results for RM3+ALL. As shown in Table 1, RM3+ALL significantly
outperforms both baselines (NoPRF and RM3) in all collections, in
terms of MAP. The P@10 values achieved by the proposed method
is also higher than those achieved by the baselines, in all cases. This
shows that our modification to RM3 leads to better performance by
satisfying the proposed constraints. Our modification also makes
the relevance model more robust, especially in the web collection.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

In this paper, we proposed two novel constraints for pseudo-relevance
feedback models, which focus on the interdependence relation
of the existing constraints that have been previously considered
as independent. To show the importance of these interdependent
constraints, we studied and modified two state-of-the-art pseudorelevance feedback models; the log-logistic and the relevance models. Our evaluation on three standard newswire and web collections
investigates the effect of each of these constraints on the overall
effectiveness and robustness of the models. Our modifications lead
to significant improvements over the baselines in all the collections.
These observations suggest that taking the interdependence relationship of the constraints into account might lead to designing
more accurate IR models, which could be an interesting research
direction for future work.
