ABSTRACT

setting remained the same as the original BM25. Cummins et al. [1]
first investigated the effect of query length on normalization but
didn’t measure the effect. [2, 6, 7] used query length normalization
constraints to estimate term-specific parameters, which may be
expensive and overfitted. Chung et al. [15] have incorporated the
query-length into vector space model and conducted experiments
on Chinese and English corpora, suggesting that the query-length
should be incorporated in other existing ranking functions. So it is
worth studying how to simply and effectively incorporate query
length into probabilistic model.
In this paper, we propose a new term frequency normalization
for probabilistic BM25, and integrate it into state-of-the-art BM25based models with proximity and topic modeling. We also present
experiments on TREC data sets to investigate the effect of three
term frequency normalization functions.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We propose
a modified BM25 via a new term frequency normalization method
in Section 2. In Section 3, we set up our experimental environment
on eight TREC data sets. In Section 4, the experimental results are
presented and discussed. Finally, we conclude our work briefly and
present future research directions in Section 5.

In probabilistic BM25, term frequency normalization is one of the
key components. It is often controlled by parameters k 1 and b,
which need to be optimized for each given data set. In this paper,
we assume and show empirically that term frequency normalization
should be specific with query length in order to optimize retrieval
performance. Following this intuition, we first propose a new term
frequency normalization with query length for probabilistic information retrieval, namely BM25QL. Then BM25QL is incorporated into
the state-of-the-art models CRTER2 and LDA-BM25, denoted as
CRTER2QL and LDA-BM25QL respectively. A series of experiments show
that our proposed approaches BM25QL, CRTER2QL and LDA-BM25QL are
comparable to BM25, CRTER2 and LDA-BM25 with the optimal b
setting in terms of MAP on all the data sets.

OUR PROPOSED APPROACH

In this section, we first introduce a new term frequency normalization approach, and then describe how to integrate it into probabilistic BM25. For clarification, Table 1 outlines the notations used
throughout the paper.

INTRODUCTION AND RELATED WORK

Term frequency (TF) normalization is very important in information
retrieval (IR) models. There are kinds of term frequency normalization achieving success. Sub-linear term frequency normalization
in BM25 [10] is one of state-of-the-art approaches in the last two
decades. It has two hyper-parameters (k 1 and b), which are as term
independent constants and often need to be optimized for each
given data set [4]. In recent years, much research work started
to focus on the automatic tuning of document length normalization. TF normalization approaches in [4, 8, 9, 14] are document
and collection dependent, and fixed term-independent parameter

A New Method for TF Normalization

a query q as follows.

length dl. In practice, b is usually set to a default value or optimized for each individual data set. Generally, parameter b should
be optimized for each given collection [4], so it is worth exploring
a modified term frequency normalization.
In previous work [11], the query length, i.e. ql, the number of
terms in a query q, is used to balance two kinds of TF normalization.
From an information theoretic perspective, adding a term to the
query is equivalent to increasing the information provided by the
query. We assume that when query length increases, the effect of TF
Normalization should be boosted, in order to facilitate preference
to shorter documents. Based on this assumption, we propose a new
method for document TF normalization using query length.
tf
T FQ L =

dl
(1 − bQ L (ql)) + bQ L (ql) · avdl
where bQ L (ql) is a given function of query length ql. Heuristically,
this function bQ L (ql) should increase with the growth of query
length, while it must lie between 0 and 1. In addition, when a
term is added to a shorter query, it is more likely to show more
search intent than added to a longer query. Thus, bQ L (ql) should
be less affected with the change of ql for larger ql. Specifically, we
characterize bQ L (ql) as follows.

way as the BM25 in CRTER2 and LDA-BM25, and propose CRTER2QL
and LDA-BM25QL respectively. Similarly, we also investigate term
frequency normalization functions in CRTER2QL and LDA-BM25QL.

To satisfy the above characteristics, we propose several different
types of functions as in Formula (3)-(5). These three functions are
proposed to satisfy all the required characteristics for bQ L (ql). In
addition, the proposed functions grow differently when the query

4 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
4.1 Comparison with BM25
We first investigate the performance of our proposed BM25QL compared with BM25. The experimental results are presented in Figure
1. As shown by the results, our proposed BM25QL models are comparable to BM25 with optimal b on almost all data sets in terms
of MAP. Moreover, according to the results in Figure 1, each new
term frequency normalization function has its advantage on some
aspects. There is no single function can outperform others on all the
data sets. Without much knowledge of a new data set, logarithmic
function is recommended for BM25QL.

A New Model: BM25QL

We use the query length for term frequency normalization in BM25
and propose a new BM25QL formula as follows.

EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS

We conduct experiments on eight standard TREC data sets, which
include AP88-89 with queries 51-100, LA with queries 301-400,
WSJ(87-92) with queries 151-200, DISK1&2 with queries 51-200,
DISK4&5 no CR with queries 301-450, Robust04 with queries 301450 & 601-700, WT2G with queries 401-450 and WT10G with queries
451-550. These data sets are different in sizes and genres, including
high-quality newswire collections and Web collections containing
many noisy documents. In all the experiments, we only use the title
field of the TREC queries for retrieval. Queries without judgments
are removed. For all test data sets used, each term is stemmed
by using Porter’s English stemmer. Standard English stopwords
are removed. The official TREC evaluation measure is used in our
experiments, namely Mean Average Precision (MAP).
For fair comparisons, we use the following parameter settings
for both the baselines and our proposed models, which are popular
in the IR domain for building strong baselines. First, in BM25, k 1
and k 3 are set to be 1.2 and 8. Meanwhile, we sweep the values of b
for BM25 from 0 to 1.0 with an interval of 0.05. Second, in CRTER2,
we sweep the values of normalization parameter σ in a group of
different values 2, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 75, 100, and triangle kernel was
shown in [5] to achieve best MAP for most data sets. Thirdly, in
LDA modeling, we use symmetric Dirichlet priors with α = 50/Kt
and β = 0.01, which are common settings in the literature and
shown in [3, 16] that retrieval results were not very sensitive to
the values of these parameters. The number of topics Kt is set to
be 400 as recommended in [3, 16]. Finally, we sweep the values
of balancing parameter λ from 0.1 to 0.9 with an interval of 0.1 in
CRTER2, CRTER2QL , LDA-BM25 and LDA-BM25QL.

Comparison with CRTER2

In order to test the robustness, we incorporate our proposed BM25QL
models into various types of BM25-based models. Firstly, we use
BM25QL to tune the parameter b in the state-of-the-art BM25-based
proximity approaches. Zhao et al. [5] showed that bigram cross
term model CRTER2 is at least comparable to major probabilistic
proximity models PPM [12] and BM25TP [13] in BM25-based framework. We compare our proposed CRTER2QL with CRTER2. The results
are presented in Figure 2. Figure 2 shows that the proposed CRTER2QL
models are also comparable to CRTER2 with optimal b on almost
all data sets.

In this paper, we explore three term frequency normalization
functions in BM25, and the corresponding BM25QL are denoted as
BM25QLLOG , BM25QLREC and BM25QLEXP respectively.
Recent years, there are some state-of-the-art BM25-based models
succeeded in IR. For example, bigram cross term model CRTER2 in [5]
is a well known probabilistic proximity model, and LDA-BM25 in
[3] is a strong topic based hybrid model. We use BM25QL in the same

Comparison with LDA-BM25

First, it is interesting to conduct an in-depth study on complete
new term frequency normalization without hyper-parameters k 1
and b. Second, we will investigate the optimal term frequency normalization function. Third, we also plan to evaluate our models on
more data sets including some real data sets and apply our models
into real world applications.

Finally, we further incorporate our proposed BM25QL models into
state-of-the-art BM25-based model with topic modeling. Jian et
al. [3] showed that LDA-BM25 is at least comparable to the state-ofthe-art model CRTER2. The performance of our proposed LDA-BM25QL
and LDA-BM25 is presented in Figure 3. From Figure 3, we can find
that LDA-BM25QL models are also comparable to LDA-BM25 with
optimal b in MAP on almost all data sets. The performance is even
better than searching the parameter space on several data sets, such
as LA, WSJ, DISK1&2 and WT2G.

Analysis and Discussion

The experimental results show that our proposed models have consistent good performance in all scenarios on all data sets. In some
occasions, the performance is even better than the heuristic best
b-value. This is because that the new variable bQ L is self-adjusted
for each query, while given the heuristic b-value is tested for all
queries on an entire collection. bQ L is more adaptive, especially in
real applications when the queries are quite different from each
other. The functions proposed in Formula (3)-(5) perform similarly
in terms of MAP. Although more functions could be considered to
define the bQ L , most of the functions grow faster than the logarithm function and slower compared with the exponential function.
According to the experimental results, we can see that the retrieval
performance can be guaranteed using any of the proposed functions
in Formula (3)-(5).

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

In this paper, we propose a new term frequency normalization
model BM25QL for probabilistic IR. Specifically, we present three
term frequency normalization functions: logarithmic function, reciprocal function and exponential function. We also incorporate
BM25QL into two state-of-the-art BM25-based models CRTER2 and
LDA-BM25. Experimental results on eight standard TREC data sets
show that BM25QL, CRTER2QL and LDA-BM25QL at least comparable to
and sometimes even better than BM25, CRTER2 and LDA-BM25
with the optimal b in terms of MAP.
In the future, we will conduct experiments on more large data
sets with different types, such as GOV2 and ClueWeb09. There are
also several interesting future research directions for us to explore.
