ABSTRACT

• Length: half-day (3 hours plus breaks).

Wikipedia - the online encyclopedia - has long been used as
a source of information for researchers, as well as being a
subject of research itself [11, 12, 23, 5, 6] . Wikipedia has
been shown to be effective in recommender systems, sentiment analysis, validation and multiple domains in information retrieval. One of the reasons for Wikipedia’s popularity
among researchers and practitioners is the multiple types of
information it contains, which enables practitioners to select the right ”tool” for their respective tasks. In addition
to its great potential, this multitude of information sources
also poses a challenge: which sources of information are best
suited for a specific problem and how can different types of
data be combined?
This tutorial aims to provide a holistic view of Wikipedia’s
different features - text, links, categories, page views, editing history etc. - and explore the different ways they can be
utilized in a machine learning framework. By presenting and
contrasting the latest works that utilize Wikipedia in multiple domains, this tutorial aims to increase the awareness
among researchers and practitioners in these fields to the
benefits of utilizing Wikipedia in their respective domains,
in particular to the use of multiple sources of information
simultaneously.

• Intended audience: intermediate and advanced audience, researchers and practitioners in (one or more
of) the following fields: machine learning, information
retrieval, recommender systems and natural language
processing.

OBJECTIVES

Our aim for this tutorial is to provide our participants
with a working knowledge in the following areas:
• Become familiar with the different sources of information available in Wikipedia and the various features
that can be derived from them.
• Possess the understanding which of the Wikipedia features can be successfully applied in various domains.
• Become acquainted with the various ways in which machine learning can be used to leverage the knowledge
stored in Wikipedia.
• How Wikipedia’s structure of semi-structured textual
entities can be used to leverage the search and retrieval
missions.

H.3.3 [Information Search and Retrieval]: Miscellaneous

We partition the applications utilizing Wikipedia in learningbased tasks into four application domains: recommender
systems, ranking, information retrieval and knowledge acquisition and validation. Each of these domains can also
be divided into tasks, which are reviewed in depth throught
the tutorial. The full taxonomy of Wikipedia applications is
presented in Figure 1. We now briefly review each of these
domains.

Keywords
Wikipedia, Information Retrieval, Machine Learning

BRIEF DESCRIPTION

We propose tutorial on Wikipedia1 as a knowledge source
that leverages various Information Retrieval and Machine
learning tasks.

RELEVANCE

1. Information retrieval - the goal of this application
domain is to provide information which is best-suited
for the information needs of the user. In this application domain Wikipedia is used for multiple purposes,
including the enrichment of the original query (query
expansion) and the identification of relevant entities
(entity-based information retrieval).

2. Recommender systems - the goal of this application
domain is to identify items that are best suited for a
given user and to infer the similarity of various items.
Because of its hyper connected structure and the massive amounts of information it contains, Wikipedia is
highly useful in this domain.

utilized
3. Ranking - the goal of this domain is to determine
the relative standing of items. Being a collaborative
database, Wikipedia can be used to harness the ”wisdom of the crowd” for this task.

(a) Information retrieval - query performance prediction.
(b) Sentiment analysis - measuring word relatedness.
(c) Recommender systems and items similarity - we
will review the different methods by which Wikipedia
similarity could be utilized to improve ratings prediction

4. Knowledge acquisition and validation - this application domain includes two tasks: a) the extraction
of structured knowledge (ontologies) from Wikipedia
and; b) the utilization of Wikipedia for the validation
of hypothesis and conclusions.

(d) Ranking - we will describe methods that utilize
different features of Wikipedia for the purpose of
ranking real-world entities.

In addition to a comprehensive review of the various domains in which Wikipedia can be utilized, we will also provide the participants with detailed references to the various
studies which utilize Wikipedia’s multiple features. Some of
the information that will be provided to the participants is
presented in Table 1.

4.

(e) Knowledge acquisition and validation - we will
demonstrate how knowledge acquired from Wikipedia
could be used to validate solutions to ”soft” problems (problems that do not have one ”right” solution) such as clustering.
We suggest to provide hands-on faculty sessions, based on
the outcomes and experience gained through leading projects
and authoring papers [11, 12, 23, 13, 17, 2, 19, 18, 29] related
to the abovementioned topics.

FORMAT AND SCHEDULE
We suggest the following outline of the tutorial:
1. Introduction to Wikipedia - a short review of its size,
scope, growth rate and additional statistics. We will
then describe the different application domains presented in Figure 1, thus enabling the audience to identify the domains that are relevant and related to its
fields of interest.
2. Wikipedia as a knowledge base - we provide an overview
of the various ways by which Wikipedia’s text, links,
categories, page views etc. can be utilized in a machine
learning context.
3. For each of the following domains, we provide a review of the domain, and the leading works in the field.
Then, we focus on a single project which requires significant use of machine learning. Projects from the
following fields will be reviewed:
