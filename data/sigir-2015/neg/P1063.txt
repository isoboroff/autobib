Categories and Subject Descriptors

internal structures and representation for similarity search; searching – interpretation of user query and expansion; evaluation – continuous evaluation of retrieval quality; performance – the internal
representations must support a good overall performance.
Based on the NTCIR-11 Math-2 Task evaluation, MIaS approach
is currently one of the best ranked in terms of the system’s effectiveness [1]. In my work, I want to build upon the current performance
of MIaS and research further methods and topics that could possibly
make the system perform even better. The topics are the following:

H.3.3 [Information Systems]: Information storage and Retrieval—
Information Search and Retrieval; I.7 [Computing Methodologies]: Document and text Processing—Index Generation

Keywords
query expansion, digital mathematical libraries, indexing mathematics, MIaS, MathML, formula, subformula unification, evaluation

Motivation

Semantically Enhanced Search – integration of Computer algebra systems in the indexing as well as the searching phase
as a computational power to reduce math expressions to a
normalized form. Disambiguation of math structures from
document and queries into known concepts in order to introduce semantics into the matching.

Mathematics Information Retrieval (MIR) is a domain specific
branch of Information Retrieval. MIR is a broad term for all the
activities related to obtaining information from a collection of resources and answering an information need that involves mathematics in the form of math expressions and formulae. MIR is very
important for Digital Mathematics Libraries (DMLs) which gather
mathematically oriented documents in which users need to search
and navigate effectively. A concrete implementation usually means
a search engine that is able to answer a query composed of mathematical expressions as well as standard textual keywords searching
through a collection with a substantial amount of mathematics.
There are several research groups that aim at creating well performing and usable math search engine. Our group located at the
Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University, develops Math Indexer
and Searcher (MIaS) [2] – a math-aware search engine, currently
deployed in EuDML (European Digital Mathematics Library). To
the best of my knowledge, it is the only deployment of a MIR system
in such a scale. Other deployments, e.g. DML-CZ, are planned.

Subformula Unification – the ability to unify whole expression
subtrees in order to allow the users to create queries containing wildcards in math expressions. In more complex query
expressions wildcards can be critical in suppressing uninteresting parts of math expressions. The complexity of this
aspect is heavily dependent on the representation of the data.
Query Expansion/Relaxation – mathematical queries can be relaxed by dividing it to smaller parts. This is can be a fallback
method in case of unsuccessful complex query expressions.
On the keyword level, mixed mathematical-textual queries
can be relaxed by removing keywords from the individual
parts of the query.
Combined Text-Mathematical Search – math expressions and
text keywords need to be effectively combined for the system
query in terms of logical operators as well as their mutual
weighting.

The Goal
The goal is to design the ultimate math information retrieval system.
The ultimateness can be understood as a combination of specific
features that all together will support high precision as well as recall
in searching documents with mathematical content.

Evaluation Framework – preparation of an automated evaluation
framework for rigorously evaluating changes proposed to the
retrieval process as listed above. This is possible with the
presence of a test collection for MIR, such as NTCIR-11
Math-2 collection.

Research Topics and Methods
The main research aspects of MIR are the following: preprocessing – unifying the input math notation; indexing – preparation of the
