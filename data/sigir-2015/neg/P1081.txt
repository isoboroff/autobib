and relationships with other professional entities in LinkedIn's
economic graph. And all this data is in constant flux as LinkedIn
adds more than 2 members every second in over 200 countries
(2/3 of our members are outside the United States). As a result,
weâ€™ve built a system quite different from those used for other
search applications. In this talk, we will discuss some of the
unique challenges we've faced as we deliver highly personalized
search over semi-structured data at massive scale.

ABSTRACT
All of us are familiar with search as users. And as software
engineers, many of us have worked on search problems in the
context of web search, site search, or enterprise search. But
search at LinkedIn is different. Our corpus is a richly structured
professional graph comprised of 364M+ people, 3M+ companies,
2M+ groups, and 1.5M+ publishers. Our members perform
billions of searches (over 5.7B in 2012), and each of those
searches is highly personalized based on the searcher's identity
