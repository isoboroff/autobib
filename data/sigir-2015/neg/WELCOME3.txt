Short Papers
The Short Papers Track received 252 submissions, of which 79 were accepted (31% acceptance).
Each submitted paper received three reviews in a double-blind process, together with an overall
meta-review from one of the three Chairs. Short papers are four pages in length, and will be
presented at the conference during what can be expected to be a highly engaging Poster Session.
We thank the many referees who contributed to the reviewing process, and are particularly grateful to John Tait, who managed a separate Short Paper conflict of interest track for submissions
co-authored by any of the three Chairs. We look forward to the lively discussions that always
accompany the SIGIR Poster Session

Demonstrations
The Demonstrations Track received 24 submissions of which 12 were accepted. We thank the
pool of expert referees who assisted with the task of selecting the final set of demos. The results
of their work will provide a stimulating complement to the conferenceâ€™s Poster Session; and we
are confident that, as always, the successful presentations will generate extensive discussion and
lead to further new ideas.

Doctoral Consortium
The Doctoral Consortium received 14 submissions this year, of which 10 were recommended
for acceptance, with almost equal representation across Asia, Europe, and America. Having
facilitated the review process, we are now looking forward to chairing the Consortium on the first
day of the conference, and welcoming and working with these new members of our community.
We are especially grateful to the 17 referees that assisted with our candidate selections, many of
whom will also be mentors on the day.
