ABSTRACT

documents (known as ten "blue links" or "organic results"), might
become not so effective when users issue their queries to search
engines.
To advance the efficiency of information search
behaviors, it is popular for commercial search portals such as
Google, Yahoo! to blend some specific vertical results, whose
contents are assembled from other data sources, into the ranked
list of standard results. Since users could instantly obtain the
information that they expected from relevant verticals, search
behavior might be inevitably affected by these "special results". A
good example of this is attractiveness bias [5, 9, 28], which shows
that users may adopt their visual attention to verticals more
quickly, ignoring the other documents on SERPs. It is, therefore,
important to gain a good understanding of the influences of
vertical results on search behaviors in designing federated search
system.
Because of the special design of vertical documents, the
embedment of verticals has revolutionized the way users find
information on SERPs. Many prior studies have revealed this
phenomenon. Chen et al [9] are among the first to propose a
federated click model and demonstrate the difference in users’
click behaviors in federated search. Wang et al. [28] further found
the existence of presentation bias that may lead to different
examination behavior on both verticals and other surrounding
results, with the help of eye-tracking equipments. Lagun et al.
[20] and Arguello et al. [1] indicated that the relevance of verticals
could affect search behaviors, including gaze activity and cursor
movements.
Although these previous works have revealed the difference in
user behavior between federated and traditional search, it is still
not sufficient to draw a complete picture of the process of user
examination in practical web search scenario. Firstly, compared to
the homogeneous presentation style of the organic results,
verticals have a wide variety of presentation styles, which might
lead to different examination behaviors on the SERPs. Most prior
studies, such as [5, 9, 28, 29], commonly divided the vertical type
into two categories: textual and multimedia. And the effects of
these two types were measured and analyzed independently.
However, with the increasing diversity of verticals, the content of
vertical documents does not only contain one single type of items.
Rather, the vertical blocks that contain both multimedia and
textual snippets (e.g., news) exist widely in commercial search
engines. The examination behavior might vary on this "mixed type
verticals". For example, Figure 1 shows an example of the
attention heatmaps for news and image verticals. Interestingly,
while users are more likely to be attracted by multimedia verticals
[9, 28], our findings indicate that news vertical, which also
contained image element in their snippets, do not attract more
visual attention on the image (i.e. the users examine carefully on

Research in how users examine results on search engine result
pages (SERPs) helps improve result ranking, advertisement
placement, performance evaluation and search UI design.
Although examination behavior on organic search results (also
known as "ten blue links") has been well studied in existing works,
there lacks a thorough investigation on how users examine SERPs
with verticals. Considering the fact that a large fraction of SERPs
are served with one or more verticals in the practical Web search
scenario, it is of vital importance to understand the influence of
vertical results on search examination behaviors. In this paper, we
focus on five popular vertical types and try to study their
influences on users’ examination processes in both cases when
they are relevant or irrelevant to the search queries. With
examination behavior data collected with an eye-tracking device,
we show the existence of vertical-aware user behavior effects
including vertical attraction effect, examination cut-off effect in
the presence of a relevant vertical, and examination spill-over
effect in the presence of an irrelevant vertical. Furthermore, we are
also among the first to systematically investigate the internal
examination behavior within the vertical results. We believe that
this work will promote our understanding of user interactions with
federated search engines and bring benefit to the construction of
search performance evaluations.

the textual snippets without much attention on the image snippet).
Secondly, previous works [1, 18, 19] pointed out that vertical
quality leads to different user interaction patterns and
satisfactions. However, these studies only focus on the page level
effect, such as the spill-over effect [1], which means that users
might prefer to interact with the web results when the vertical
corresponds to the users’ intention. To some extent, this limits the
in-depth analysis of user decision process at result level within
verticals of different quality. Essentially, as we demonstrate in our
experiments in Section 4.1, the spill-over effect may contribute to
different examination distributions on organic results, especially
those close to the verticals. In addition, very little is known about
the internal examination of different items presented in the vertical
block from the previous studies. A better understanding of the
internal examination will help us take a step further to
comprehend the cognitive mechanisms in federated search and
design better vertical user interfaces.

performed a crowd-sourcing study with explicit user assessments
and found similar visual saliency biases. Diaz et al. [11] mined
users’ mouse movement interactions and found that different
result appearances might lead to different bias strengths. Arguello
et al. [1] focused on studying aggregated search coherence, which
means the extent to which results from different verticals focus on
similar senses of an ambiguous or underspecified query. They
found that users are more likely to interact with the web results
when the vertical results are consistent with the user’s intended
query sense. By exploiting a commercial search engine log, Chen
et al. [9] found that users are more likely to end his/her search
sessions immediately after clicking the vertical results.
Most of the work mentioned above focus on implicit signals
such as clicks and mouse movements, or explicit user assessments
while we move one step forward, towards further understanding of
user behavior (especially users’ attention) through eye-tracking
devices. We revisit some of the biases such as visual saliency,
vertical relevance and vertical ranked position, and also obtain
several new findings.

The contribution of the paper is two fold:
• We study the influence of vertical type, embedding position
and vertical relevance on users’ search examination process;
• We investigate the examination process among different subcomponents within the vertical block.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents
an overview of the related work. Then we thoroughly describe the
experimental design for collecting user behavior data. In section 4,
we provide the analysis of user examination behavior on SERPs. A
summary of this paper is presented in Section 5.

RELATED WORK

2.1

Federated Search

Eye-tracking Studies in Web Search

Eye-tracking device has been widely utilized in understanding
user behavior on both sponsored search [8, 24, 12] and organic
search results [14, 18, 19]. Since the eye tracker can record users’
real-time eye movement information on SERPs, it helps
researchers better understand how users examine results. Granka
et al. [14], and Joachims et al. [18, 19] are among the first works
that start this line of research on organic SERPs and they all found
that there exists position bias during users’ examination processes.
[10] revealed the connection between the length of contextual
snippet and user performance by using eye tracking techniques.
Recently, Liu et al. [22] indicated that the examination process of
search results might have two steps (skim and read) and proposed
a two-stage examination model based on the eye-tracking analysis.
Eye-tracking experiments also help analyze the users’ evaluation
on search results. For example, [4] showed that the personal style
(economic or exhaustive) and the result relevance can affect search
result evaluation. [7] predict the relevance of documents by using
the gaze data. Besides, eye-tracking devices are used to investigate
the relationship between eye movements and mouse movements,
such as [25, 26, 15, 17]
Researchers also conducted eye-tracking experiments in the
context of federated search. Wang et al. [28] found that different
verticals might create examination biases on the eye movement
behavior for both vertical and other results on SERPs. Lagun et al.
[20] performed a similar study on mobile devices and found that
both vertical relevance and positions have impacts on users’
attentions. [13] investigated the influence of social annotations,
which present social signals or information, on users’ performance
in web search. Navalpakkam et al. [23] found that the flow of user
attention on non-linear page layouts (e.g., with the existence of
knowledge graph components) is different from the widely
believed top-down linear examination order of the search results.
Compared to previous work, our work performs a more
extensive eye-tracking study that examines a variety of vertical
biases and their impacts in organic results on the SERP. We also
provide insights for verticals (with five different presentation
styles). Another contribution is that we study in-depth users’
examination behaviors on different items shown within vertical
blocks, which has not been studied before. The insights provided
can be helpful in assisting vertical-aware click models [9, 28] by
better estimating item-level examination probability.

How to federate search results from vertical sources into organic
web search results has been extensively studied in recent years [1,
9, 11, 28, 3, 2, 21]. Most of the current researches focus on how
to select the most relevant verticals [3, 2, 21], how to appropriately
embed vertical results into organic web results [3, 2] and how to
measure the effectiveness of the federated search pages [9, 28, 29].
Federation on the web can be also referred as aggregated search [1,
9, 28, 29].
With the introduction of verticals, the user behavior has become
more and more complex. Recently, several work aim to better
understand users’ search behavior by either conducting user
studies or performing large-scale log analysis. Sushmita et al. [27]
conducted a user study and found that users click more on video
results than the image and news results. Zhou et al. [30]

task difficulty [17], we verified that the corresponding results list
without verticals, namely organic results list, contained the
answers to these tasks, and each task was moderately easy for
most participants. At the end of the experiment, participants were
required to give some feedback about their search experience and
compensated with approximately US$10.
Before each task, participants were directed to a task
description page and given an initial query for this task. In order to
eliminate the possible ambiguities of the queries, the
corresponding description of each query was also displayed on
this page. It is worth noting that all of these 30 queries were
selected from real-world commercial search logs so that they
contain the practical users’ search intention. Once participants had
read the task description and confirmed what they should look for,
they could click the search button and begin the search processes
on the SERPs. To make sure that all participants see the same
SERPs while performing a certaining search tasks, we crawled the
SERPs from search engines and stored them in our web servers.
This allowed us to have a consistent initial SERP for each query
and to strictly control the experimental variables, which may lead
to differences in users’ behavior. After these initial SERPs were
displayed, there were no restrictions on users’ behavior on the
search result pages. In other words, participants could be free to
behave on the SERP as usual in all ways, such as click links or
scroll the screen. The aim of this design is to create a realistic
scenario for federated search in a laboratory environment.
Furthermore, during the search process, participants’ eye
movements were recorded by the eye-tracker and their cursor
activities, such as click, hover and scroll, were also simultaneously
logged by the embedded JavaScript code. Once users are satisfied
or too frustrated to continue, they could finish browsing the SERP
and click the "finished" button to move on to the next search task.
It took about 40 to 60 minutes for each participant to complete the
whole experimentation.

Experimental Design

To gain good insights into users’ search strategies and processes
on SERPs with verticals, we designed an eye-tracking experiment
in which participants were asked to complete 30 search tasks.
Considering that different layouts and presentation styles of the
SERPs may affect users’ behavior, we implemented a controlled
search engine system to collect users’ interaction data. With the
system, we present different SERPs to users and track their
interaction, such as the gaze duration or movement patterns on the
different results of the SERPs.
The SERPs we present to the users vary in three aspects that
might have effects in users’ examination behavior (i.e. the three
independent variables we manipulated in the study):
• Vertical type (see Figure 4(b) for examples): textual,
encyclopedia, image-only, application-download, news or
none (i.e. organic results).
Due to the existence of
presentation bias in federated search [9, 28], vertical type
plays an important role in affecting users’ search behavior.
In our experimentation, we selected five different types,
which are among the most popular types in commercial
search engines, and embedded them into the organic result
list respectively.
• Vertical position. Since position bias affects user attention in
federated search engine [9, 28], this factor was also taken into
account in our experimentation. Vertical results are randomly
placed at position 1, 3 and 5 of result lists, respectively.
• Vertical quality. Users’ interaction on SERPs may also be
influenced by the relevance of results, not only in traditional
"ten blue links" but also in sponsored [8] and federated
searches [1]. Therefore, both "on topic" (relevant) and
"off-topic" (irrelevant) results are also included in result
lists.

3.2.1

The dependent variables we aim to track in terms of users’
examination are:
• Vertical block itself. This again is to study the presentation
bias of vertical results under different conditions as an
extension of previous work [14, 28].
• Organic results around the vertical. This is to study the users’
interaction of the organic results from the perspective of eye
fixation under different conditions, which is different from
previous works that focus only on implicit interaction signals
[1, 11] (e.g. clicks, mouse movements).
• Items within vertical blocks. This is to investigate the
examination patterns and the interaction of different
elements in the vertical block, which is novel and not
studied in previous work.

3.2

SERP Generation

In this paper, we focus on the influence of five major types of
vertical results, which were widely applied in current search
engines. We modelled the layout of the SERPs based on a
commercial search engine, which ensure the realistic and natural
appearance of result lists.
A federated SERP in our
experimentation mainly consist of one specific vertical and nine
organic links. All of these results, including vertical and organic
results, were crawled from the same search engine, and the
presentation order of these organic results remained the same.
When a participant searched a query, the vertical result (if any)
was randomly selected from a pool of verticals of different quality
(relevant or irrelevant) and integrated into the SERP at Position 1
(the top of the first viewport), Position 3 (the middle of the first
viewport) or Position 5 (the bottom of the first viewport). It is
worth noting that all the organic result lists contained the answers
(see Section 3.1) to the tasks so that the difficulty of the federated
SERPs was similar regardless of the relevance of the vertical.
Following the pre-procedure steps above, we implemented 180
initially fixed SERPs with verticals and 30 organic-only SERPs in
total.

Experimental Protocol

Our experimental study is processed in the following steps.
Firstly, to ensure that each participant was familiar with the
operation of our experimental system and the experiment
procedure, they were asked to finish two warm-up tasks. During
this step, participants only perceived that their interactions with
the search system, including eye activities and mouse movements,
will be recorded and were unaware of the real purpose of our
study. Then, participants were asked to go through calibration
processes before they start the main search tasks so as to collect
accurate and reliable eye movement data. Next, every participant
performed the same set of 30 search tasks, followed by an exit
questionnaire. To eliminate the influence of the different levels of

3.2.2

Apparatus

We deployed a Tobii X2-30 eye tracker to capture participants’
eye movements and deploy the search system on a 17” LCD
monitor whose resolution is 1360*768. The Internet Explorer 11
browser was used to display the pages of search system, including
the description pages and search result pages. As the vertical may

occupy more space of the SERP, the page fold was commonly
between the results at the positions 5 and 6. For identifying user
examination behavior, we detect fixations using built-in algorithms
from Tobii Studio. In these algorithms, the gaze whose duration
was above 60ms around a specific location would be collected and
treated as a fixation.

Participants

Altogether 35 participants (aged 18 to 25, mean = 18.8) with
informed consent were recruited in our experimentation. Because
subjects were expected to have a variety of backgrounds, all of
these participants were selected from a wide range of majors (e.g.,
biology, economics, engineering etc.) of a university. Because of
the calibration problems with the eye tracker, not all of their eye
movement data were available. As a result, data from 32 of these
participants was finally taken into account. Particularly, most of
the participants had normal vision and were able to browse the
on-screen web pages without wearing glasses. Additionally, all the
participants self-reported that they were familiar with the
operation of search engines and were confident that the SERPs
that we provided come from the original search engine without
modifications.

experimentation. Furthermore, to eliminate the effects of task
order or other possible learning biases [18, 19, 20], the tasks in
each group were presented in a random order. After asking the
participants whether they had noticed any variations in search
performance among those tasks, none of them detected any
differences among these conditions.

Search Tasks

EXAMINATION BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS

In the following section, we describe the main findings of the
users’ examination patterns on the SERP with the presence of the
vertical results, compared to the ones with only organic results.
Especially, we want to know how users’ attention are distributed
across different page elements (embedded vertical, surrounding
organic results). Specifically, we aim to answer the following
research questions (RQs):

Each of participants was instructed to perform 30 search tasks
using our search system. As described in Section 3.1, to generate
appropriate initial queries, we sample a set of "medium frequency"
queries from raw search logs, which come from a major
commercial search engine. And then, the original SERPs related
to these queries were examined one by one, and the SERPs that
contained less than three specific verticals could be selected into
the initial SERP set. This setup was chosen to reduce the influence
of excessive modification of SERPs and be consistent with the
realistic scenario as far as possible. Finally, 30 eligible queries
were selected and regarded as the initial task queries in our study.
Table 1 shows a set of example search tasks. For each task, the
presented verticals on the initial SERP were either relevant or
irrelevant. In order to generate the irrelevant vertical results, we
use reformulated queries which are modified from the initial task
queries collected from practical search logs [1, 8, 28] to retrieve
the vertical. Most of the reformulated queries are generalization or
specification as shown in Table 1 while the selection criteria is
similar to [1] as to reflect the different facets of the query. Since
the irrelevant verticals also contained terms from the original
queries, the appearance of the irrelevant vertical hyperlinks was
similar to the relevant ones. The aim of this is to make the
occurrence of irrelevant verticals more natural and reasonable.
Base on the interview of the participants, none of them noticed the
SERPs with irrelevant verticals had been modified.
In our experimentation, the participants experienced one of the
thirty-one experimental conditions (5 vertical types × 3 position
× 2 quality conditions of vertical + 1 organic-only result page)
for each task. To make sure that all tasks would be completed with
equal opportunities in each condition, we used a Graeco-Latin
square design [8, 16] of tasks and conditions. Based on this
design, we were able to strictly control the effects of tasks and
conditions. The task conditions were divided into six groups. Each
group consisted of five vertical types, including textual,
encyclopedia, image-only, application-download and news. For
each specific type, there were six initial pages, which were split by
three positions and two levels of quality, corresponding to the
tasks. Thus, each participant who performed in one of these six
groups would fairly complete all conditions in the

• (RQ1) Are there any attraction biases in the presence of
vertical results? How do the vertical type, embedded
position and relevance affect these biases?
• (RQ2) Are there any effects in users’ attention to organic
results around verticals? How do the vertical type, embedded
position and relevance affect these biases?
• (RQ3) Given different verticals and their presentation
styles, what are the examination probabilities of different
items within the internal vertical block? What are the
common browsing patterns among these items?
Since the SERPs in our experiment are organized in a blended
fashion [1, 28], i.e. the results (either organic or vertical) are formed
into blocks and ranked from top to bottom, we can simply track
users’ interactions on different ranked positions. In this work, it is
assumed that the SERP generally consists of nine organic results
and one vertical result block that is embedded within the organic
results. In the following sections, we first investigate user attention
in terms of gaze duration on different results (ranked positions) in
Section 4.1, followed by a detailed analysis of the gaze duration
and movement patterns within vertical blocks in Section 4.2.

4.1

Examination Behavior on SERPs with
Verticals

First, we present in Table 2 the overall results of how users
allocate their attentions on the SERPs based on the different
independent variables that we manipulated. The user attention is
measured by the fixation distribution we obtained from the
eye-tracker.
The top part of Table 2 shows the attention
distribution of the pure organic result lists and is treated as our
baseline for comparison. Note that due to the small fraction of
users’ attention on the results ranked below position 5 (e.g. 6.81%
for organic only SERPs), we present the results of position 6-10 as

196

Table 2: The user attention (eye fixation distribution) of each ranked position on the SERP when different types and quality of
verticals are embedded at various positions on the SERPs. Two-tailed t-test is performed to detect any significant changes against
the user attention on organic results only SERPs. Significant results are bold while * and ** represent p < 0.05 and 0.01, respectively.
The block color represents the user attention’s change of direction compared with organic only SERPs (red denotes increment and
blue represents decrement) while the brightness of the color indicates the (normalized) change magnitude.

Not surprisingly, aligned with previous
eye-tracking results [9, 28], the users’ attention on the
organic-only results decreases as the ranked position increased on
the SERP.
We then present the attention distributions of various verticals
that are embedded in different positions (1, 3, 5). In Table 2, the
left and right side of the table respectively present the results of
when the vertical is relevant and irrelevant. In Table 2, we can
observe that when there is no vertical (organic-only SERP),
46.03% and 27.92% of users’ fixations are focused on position 1
and 2, respectively. If there is a relevant textual vertical embedded
at position 1 on the SERP, the fixation on position 1 (vertical)
increases to 61.93%, meanwhile the one of the position 2 (web)
decreases to 17.79%.
This demonstrates that the vertical
embedded in the first result of the SERP significantly
(p-value=0.05) attracts more user attention compared to a
presented organic web result. Similarly, by examining and
comparing the attention distribution in Table 2, we can observe a
number of interesting findings, as discussed below.

corresponding one on the organic-only SERP). This attraction
effect is strong for almost all different types of verticals at all
embedded positions (1, 3, 5) when the vertical results are relevant
(left side of Table 2). We can observe that there are significant
increases over the organic-only SERP except for positions 1 and 5
of news vertical. This attraction bias is highly significant
(p-value<0.01) for image-only and application-download verticals
for all positions, position 3 and 5 for encyclopedia and position 3
for news verticals. From the perspective of vertical embedding
positions, the attraction bias is strongest in the 3rd ranking
position where all verticals obtain statistically significant increases
over the organic-only SERP in terms of attention.
When the vertical is irrelevant (right side of Table 2), we can
observe that there is still a strong bias towards verticals on
positions 3 and 5, especially for image-only and applicationdownload verticals. Although as expected, all the attraction bias is
diminished compared to the cases where verticals are relevant.
The results above are interesting but not surprising, as users can
easily distinguish a vertical result block from organic results
(e.g. image-only, application-download). When the vertical is
relevant (potentially the vertical results are what the users are
looking for), the users tend to pay more attention to the vertical
results. Note that although this attraction bias effect has also been
noticed in previous eye-tracking based studies [28], we investigate
more verticals with various presentation styles. We also study how
the vertical relevance (or namely orientation in [27, 29]) affects

Attraction Effect

Firstly, we focus on users’ attention allocation on the vertical
results themselves (to answer RQ1), i.e. tracking solely the user
attention on the corresponding vertical embedded position: 1, 3, 5.
As shown in Table 2, we find a strong attraction bias towards
vertical results once it is presented (compared to the

the user’s interaction and reaffirms previous results through
eye-tracking (rather than the click-through analysis).
To further analyze this effect in terms of whether users are
attracted by the vertical results and tend to examine them first
(with respect to the temporal sequence), we analyze the arrival
time distribution of different ranked positions when the various
vertical results are embedded in different positions. The results are
shown in Figure 2. The x-axis is the ranked positions while the
y-axis is the first arrival of eye fixation for a given position
(normalized by the whole session length due to user variabilities
[27]). We can observe from Figure 2(a) that when there is a
vertical shown at position 1 with a strong visual bias in the
snippets (e.g. image-only, application and news verticals), users’
arrival time to the vertical hugely decreases, i.e. the users
recognize the vertical immediately. Due to this visual bias, users
also tend to delay their reading of the organic results presented at
the other positions compared to organic-only SERP. From Figure
3(b), we can see that users are still attracted to image-only and
application-download vertical presented at position 3, but this is
not the case for news, encyclopedia and textual verticals.
Interestingly, for the news vertical, the users’ first arrival time at
position 3 is quite different from when shown in the first position
(weaker attraction bias). This can be explained by the fact that
information in the news vertical may be already covered in organic
results with similar content. Therefore, there is no need for users
to pay so much attention to news verticals. Figure 3(c) shows
similar results while image-only and application-download
verticals attract much attention on position 5.

verticals, although not all of the engagement differences are
significant.
To study how users pay attention to the organic results ranked
below the vertical results after they have examined the relevant
vertical results, we present the percentage of fixation duration on
these lowly ranked organic results and their normalized
differences with the organic-only SERPs in Table 3. We can see
that after users have viewed the vertical results, they tend to
decrease their visual attention on the organic results which are
below these verticals, especially when the image-only and
application-download verticals was embedded at position 3.
Overall, we refer to this effect of paying less attention to the
organic results ranked below the relevant vertical as the cut-off
effect. From Table 3, we can observe that the cut-off effect not only
depends on the types of verticals, but is also influenced by the
verticals’ positions. For example, when the verticals are at
position 5, the decrease of attention on organic results ranked
below the verticals is relatively limited, even for image-only and
application-download verticals.
However, when the vertical is irrelevant, we can see in Table
2 that compared to organic only SERP, the users consistently pay
more attention to the results after the vertical’s presence but less to
the results prior to the vertical embedded position. This is spill-over
effect and it has also been observed in previous work [1] although
our results indicate that the spill-over effect happens more often to
those documents posterior to the irrelevant verticals.

Cut-off and Spill-over Effect

We are also interested in users’ attention changes in the organic
results after users’ examination of the vertical results (to answer
RQ2).
To study this, firstly, we plot in Figure 3 the mean percentages of
eye fixation durations on organic results after users have examined
the verticals. We present both cases when the vertical presented is
relevant or irrelevant. From this figure, we can see that after users
examine the vertical results, the users tend to pay less attention to
organic results if the vertical is relevant and allocate more attention
to organic ones if the vertical is irrelevant. It is interesting that the
user behavior has changed when the relevance of the vertical varies.
Now we look into these two different cases in more details.
When the vertical is relevant, we can observe in Table 2 that
compared to the organic only results, the user attention on the
results ranked below the vertical in general decreased. This is
especially true for the image-only and application-download

To further examine this spill-over effect, we also present the
user attention of organic results with the relevant and irrelevant
vertical results after the users have examined the verticals in Table
4. By comparing this organic result examination distribution for
both relevant and irrelevant verticals, we found that it is the case
that the users pay more attention to the organic results for
irrelevant vertical and there are significantly differences found in
encyclopedia and image-only vertical (p-value<0.01) between the
relevant and irrelevant verticals. We also observe significant
differences at position 5 when the types of verticals are
encyclopedia and application-download (p-value<0.01). This
demonstrates that this spill-over effect varies according to the
relevance of verticals and can cause more visual attention on the
surrounding organic results, especially when the vertical is
irrelevant.

examination. We focus on these two research questions for the
following reasons:
• A good understanding of the examination probability can
help better estimate the relevance of the item within the
vertical, which could be useful in vertical-aware click
models [9]. So far most of the research only considers using
click/skip on the vertical level while utilizing the
examination and click of the items within the vertical can be
a more fine-grained feedback.
• Understanding better on the browsing patterns under
different presentation styles could be useful in studying the
decision process of how user percieve the relevance of the
vertical. The sequencial information could also help in
deciding how to best present the ranked items in order to fit
the most relevant one to the first user examined zone.

Summary

With the assistance of eye-tracking devices, Figure 4 presents
the results of the internal examination process of users. Figure
4(a) shows the examination distributions (measured by fixation) of
different components (items, vertical title, etc.) within the vertical
block, while (b) shows the vertical block presentation style for the
five verticals. Figure 4(c) shows the detailed information on how
users examine within the vertical block, specifically on the top 5
most common examination patterns and their corresponding
distributions of how they start the examination and where they end
their examination. For example, in Figure 4(c) (textual vertical),
we can observe that the most popular examination pattern is "(1,
END)" which means that the users directly examined zone 1 (i.e.
item1) and then end their vertical block examination. Similarly,
the second popular examination pattern "(0, 1, END)" indicates
the users first examined zone 0 (vertical title) and then zone 1
(item1) before ending their examination.
With respect to Figure 4(a), we can observe several interesting
trends among different vertical types. Firstly, we find that a
substantial amount of attention (around 30%) has been paid to the
vertical title (besides news vertical), which suggests that users pay
attention to the vertical type when examining/judging the
relevance of the vertical block. Secondly, the users may pay more
attention to the items that contain substantial information
(e.g. detailed textual snippets) while the examination probabilities
for different items within the vertical generally follow the trend
that the higher ranked items receive higher attention. Additionally,
it is interesting to observe that users tend to allocate their visual
attention almost equally on these similar components and the
position of these vertical components do not affect users’ internal

So far, we have extensively analyzed how users examine the
vertical and the surrounding organic results on verticals of
different types, embedded positions and relevance. To conclude,
the findings (for RQ1 and RQ2) of user attention (measured by the
gaze duration) on SERPs with verticals in the previous two
subsections can be summarized as below:
• attraction bias: there is a strong bias towards more attention
on the vertical results when the vertical results are relevant
or even irrelevant but visually appealing;
• cut-off effect: when the vertical results are relevant, there is
a strong bias towards paying less attention to the organic
results posterior to the relevant vertical;
• spill-over effect: irrelevant verticals would increase the
attention for organic results.

Examination Behavior within Vertical

Although we have gained lots of insights on how users examine
results on the SERP with vertical results, however, little is known
about how users examine the various items (components) within
vertical blocks.
In this section, we aim to understand further the user
examination patterns within different vertical blocks (to answer
RQ3). Specifically we study: (a). the examination probabilities of
viewing the various components within the verticals with various
presentation styles; (b). the most common examination patterns,
especially those reflect how users start and end their vertical

examination. For example, the percentages of fixation durations
are almost similar (around 9%) from item 2 to item 5 in the news
vertical.
We also find different attraction effects between text and image
in the vertical blocks. By comparing the eye fixations on the text
and image of encyclopedia, application-download and news
verticals, although image sometimes (e.g. 20% for image-only) is
examined, interestingly, the bias of this when examining in the
vertical block is not as high as we expected. This suggests that

although image in the vertical is visually appealing and could
trigger strong attraction bias when the users examine the SERP,
the impact of this visual attractiveness is not high after the users
has decided to further examine the vertical block. Besides this, the
influence of component size on the users’ internal examination is
also shown in Figure 4(a). We can see that, not surprisingly, the
larger components might receive more visual attention and users
tend to examine the components which contain substantial
information (e.g. detailed textual snippets) in the vertical.

corresponding effect, and "◦" represents the weak effect (exists
but is not significant) of the corresponding vertical type. "−"
means the corresponding effect did not perform in this vertical.

Now we discuss the examination pattern for each vertical. For
the textual vertical, we found that most of the attention is paid to
the first item while generally the users start or end their vertical
examination using the vertical title or the first item (item1). For
the encyclopedia vertical, we found that the users, similarly, tend
to start and end their sessions by looking at the vertical title or the
textual document while seldom using the images as the
starting/ending point to examine these vertical blocks. For the
image-only vertical, it is interesting to find that the second image
item receives more attention (see Figure 4(a)) and is examined
more often at the end of the session than the first image item. That
suggests that users tend to end their internal examination within
image-only vertical after they viewed the second image items. For
the application and news vertical, we found similar results to the
encyclopedia vertical that users mainly examines item1 and
vertical title to decide vertical relevance and the image visual bias
is also not high in the vertical block examination stage.
To summarize, in this section, we study the examination patterns
within the vertical block and found the following findings:

Internal Examination within Vertical

Our third research question (RQ3) focus on the internal
examination process within the vertical blocks. In our experiment,
it is interesting to observe that different vertical types would also
lead to a wide variety of internal examination behavior. We find
that users perfer to examine the vertical title and the detail snippets
of the first item to judge the relevance and skip the further results.
Another interesting finding is that images do not perform a strong
attraction effect when users has decided to examine the vertical
blocks. In our experiment, we also find the size of components
may also affect users’ visual attention.

Summary

In this section, we summarize the main findings and limitations
of our study.

Irrelevant

the relevant vertical, especially for image-only and applicationdownload. The results of our study reveal that this cut-off effect
widely exists in the federated search behavior. However, as shown
in Table 5, we can observe that this is not the case when the
irrelevant vertical results are presented. Besides this, we also focus
on the spill-over effect, which has been observed in prior work.
We further demonstrate that users would pay more attention on
organic results when the irrelevant vertical is placed on the SERPs.

• The users tend to examine the vertical type (title) and the
detailed snippets of the first item to judge the relevance of
the vertical and tend to skip the further results if they expect
it to be irrelevant.
• After the users decide to examine the vertical block, the
image shown within the vertical has relatively weak effect
towards users’ examination.
• The position of homogeneous components in verticals might
weakly affect users’ visual attention. Users tend to treat the
similar components equally when they examine these items
within the vertical blocks.
• The component size has a strong effect on users’ internal
examination. When the components occupy more area of
vertical block and contain detailed information, users are
more likely to examine this components and allocate more
visual attention on it.

4.3.3

Limitations

There are several potential limitations in our study. Firstly, we
mainly focused on informational and transactional search tasks
and did not explore tasks with navigational search intent [6, 20].
Because the first result for the navigational search is often the
destination site, it is difficult to distinguish the effects of verticals
from the task type bias. Secondly, to concentrate on the influence
of verticals and create a controlled lab experiment, we did not take
multiple verticals into account. In real life, more than one vertical
might be presented on SERPs. This might also affect different user
behavior.

Behavior on SERPs

Our first research question (RQ1) investigates whether
attraction biases exist in the presence of vertical result. Focusing
on the fixation distribution (see Section 4.1), we observe that not
all verticals maintain strong attraction biases when the SERPs
contain verticals. Essentially, the attraction effect is influenced by
the types of verticals, while the vertical quality (relevant or not)
does not have a huge impact. Table 5 presents the overview of
different effects according to vertical type and quality. From Table
5, it is clear that users are more likely to be attracted by the
image-only and application-download verticals than the news
ones. Interestingly, news verticals, whose user performance differs
much from the others, appear not to capture more visual attention
than the organic results (even news contain image in the vertical
block). Based on our eye-tracking analysis, we find that users may
ignore the image within the news vertical block and treat the news
items equally with the other organic results.
We are also interested in whether verticals affect users’
attention on organic results (RQ2). Based on the analysis of user
interactions after examining the vertical results, we find users may
significantly change their behavior on organic results when they
notice the presence of vertical. It is interesting to show that users
tend to reduce their attention on the organic results ranked below

5.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

As more vertical results are adopted in the Web search, it is
necessary to better understand the influence of vertical results on
user decision strategies. In this paper, we present an in-depth
study using eye-tracking techniques to explore user examination
behavior on federated search. Based on the data collected from a
controlled experimentation, we systematically analyze user
attention both at page level and result level. Our results suggest
three interesting effect in federated search. Firstly, we find
attraction effect of verticals, which has been observed in existing
studies [9, 28], is affected by vertical types and users’ search
intention. While image-only and application-download verticals

201

has the strongest attraction effect, it is interesting to note that news
verticals seem not to attract more users attention than organic
results. Secondly, we demonstrate, for the first time, that user may
drastically reduce their visual attention on organic results, after
examining the relevant verticals.
In other words, users’
examination on organic may be "cut off" by the placement of
vertical results.
In our experimentation, the SERPs with
application-download verticals perform the most significant cut-off
effect, followed by the image-only. Then, we confirm the
spill-over effect also has an influence on users’ examination
behavior. To take it a step further, we find that the spill-over effect
has some special "orientations" in federated search, which means
that users prefer to pay more attention on the organic results, when
the verticals are irrelevant or off topic.
The internal examination of verticals is another key concern in
our study. As most of prior work focused on the vertical effect at
page level, this is, to our knowledge, the first quantitative
investigation on the internal examination of verticals.
Interestingly, our findings show there is a shrap difference in
users’ attention for the different types of vertical. Interesting
directions for future work involve extending this work and
developing the popular adopted evaluation metrics based our
findings so that they can better correlate with the user preferences
on the SERPs with verticals. Moreover, predicting and modeling
the users behavior with these three effects on federated search is
another interesting challenge in our future work.
