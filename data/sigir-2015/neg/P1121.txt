Intended Audience
Information retrieval with verbose natural language queries has
gained a lot of interest in recent years both from the research community and the industry. Search with verbose queries is one of
the key challenges for many of the current most advanced search
platforms, including question answering systems (Watson or Wolfram Alpha), mobile personal assistants (Siri, Cortana and Google
Now), and entity-based search engines (Facebook Graph Search or
Knowledge Graph). Therefore, we believe that a tutorial on this
topic at SIGIR is very timely and will attract a lot of interest from
all conference participants.
Researchers in the field of analysis of search queries will benefit
the most, as this tutorial will give them an exhaustive overview of
the research in the direction of handling verbose web queries. We
believe that the tutorial will give the newcomers a complete picture of the current work, introduce important research topics in this
field, and inspire them to learn more. Practitioners and people from
the industry will clearly benefit from the discussions both from the
methods perspective, as well from the point of view of applications
where such mechanisms are starting to be applied.
After the tutorial, the audience will be able to appreciate and understand the following: (1) What are the interesting properties of
complex natural language verbose queries; (2) Challenges in effective information retrieval with verbose queries; (3) State-of-the-art

specificity [35], repetition factor [37], percentage of searches
covered by top-K% queries [37], smoothing mechanisms [46].
• Query Reduction to a Single Sub-Query
– Types of Sub-Query Candidates: Noun phrases [4], named
entities [21], individual words [33, 34], two-term combinations [26], all word subsets [16, 21, 22, 23], word
subsets with one word deleted [3, 20], matching queries
from personal query log, POS blocks, one to three word
queries without stopwords [29], right part of the query [19].

MOTIVATION

Recently, the focus of many novel search applications shifted
from short keyword queries to verbose natural language queries.
Examples include question answering systems and dialogue systems, voice search on mobile devices and entity search engines like
Facebook’s Graph Search or Google’s Knowledge Graph. However
the performance of textbook information retrieval techniques for
such verbose queries is not as good as that for their shorter counterparts. Thus, effective handling of verbose queries has become
a critical factor for adoption of information retrieval techniques in
this new breed of search applications.
Over the past decade, the information retrieval community has
deeply explored the problem of transforming natural language verbose queries using operations like reduction, weighting, expansion,
reformulation and segmentation into more effective structural representations. However, thus far, there was not a coherent and organized tutorial on this topic. In this tutorial, we aim to put together
various research pieces of the puzzle, provide a comprehensive and
structured overview of various proposed methods, and also list various application scenarios where effective verbose query processing
can make a significant difference.

RELEVANCE TO INFORMATION
RETRIEVAL COMMUNITY

As can be seen from the long list of referenced papers, in this
tutorial, we will organize related work done by the information retrieval community in the past decade, present it as a coherent story,
and summarize the research advances in the field of information
retrieval with verbose queries. Thus, it is clearly relevant to the IR
community. The theme of the proposed tutorial is most related to
the “Queries and Query Analysis” area of SIGIR 2015. It is also related to a successful series of workshops on “Query Representation
and Understanding” held at SIGIR 2010 and 2011.
To the best of our knowledge, no previous tutorials have been
offered on this research topic.
