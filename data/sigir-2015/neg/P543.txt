Abstract
The task of information retrieval (IR) has traditionally been
defined as to rank a collection of documents in response to a
query. While this definition has enabled most research progress
in IR so far, it does not model accurately the actual retrieval task
in a real IR application, where users tend to be engaged in an
interactive process with multipe queries, and optimizing the
overall performance of an IR system on an entire search session
is far more important than its performance on an individual
query.
In this talk, I will present a new game-theoretic formulation of
the IR problem where the key idea is to model information
retrieval as a process of a search engine and a user playing a
cooperative game, with a shared goal of satisfying the user's
information need (or more generally helping the user complete a
task) while minimizing the user's effort and the resource
overhead on the retrieval system. Such a game-theoretic
framework offers several benefits. First, it naturally suggests
optimization of the overall utility of an interactive retrieval
system over a whole search session, thus breaking the limitation
of the traditional formulation that optimizes ranking of
documents for a single query. Second, it models the interactions
between users and a search engine, and thus can optimize the
collaboration of a search engine and its users, maximizing the
"combined intelligence" of a system and users. Finally, it can
serve as a unified framework for optimizing both interactive
information retrieval and active relevance judgment acquisition
through crowdsourcing. I will discuss how the new framework
can not only cover several emerging directions in current IR
research as special cases, but also open up many interesting new
research directions in IR.
