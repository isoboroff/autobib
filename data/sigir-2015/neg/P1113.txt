basic click models, inference methods and evaluation principles. We
supplement this with an account of available datasets and packages
plus a live demo based on these. We also present click model
applications accompanied by examples.
We expect the tutorial to be useful for both researchers and practitioners that either want to develop new click models, use them in
their own research in other areas or apply the models described here
to improve actual search systems.

In this introductory tutorial we give an overview of click models for
web search. We show how the framework of probabilistic graphical
models help to explain user behavior, build new evaluation metrics
and perform simulations. The tutorial is augmented with a live demo
where participants have a chance to implement a click model and to
test it on a publicly available dataset.

INTRODUCTION

Click models, probabilistic models of the behavior of search
engine users, have been studied extensively by the information
retrieval community during the last five years.
A good body of work has been published on click models over
the past 5 to 10 years. Importantly, the area continues to be an
active one, with new models aimed at describing and/or predicting
behavioral data being proposed at each of the main information
retrieval conferences (SIGIR, WSDM, WWW, CIKM) over the past
few years. There is also a fair number of publications that use click
models presented in the main information retrieval conferences as
well as ACM journals such as TOIS. All this indicates that there is
a substantial and continued level of interest in the topic.
Indeed, we now have a handful of basic click models, inference
methods, evaluation principles and applications for click models,
that form the building blocks of ongoing research efforts in the area.
The time is right to organize and present this material to a broad
audience of interested information retrieval researchers, whether
junior or senior. Many of the click models available today have been
proposed by different industrial and academic research groups—one
of the key aims of our proposed tutorial is to bring these together
and offer a unified perspective. To achieve this, we describe the

OBJECTIVES

A large body of research on click models has been developed.
This research has improved our understanding of user behavior in
web search and facilitated the usage of click models in various
search-related tasks. Current studies use a broad range of notations
and terminology, perform experiments using different and mostly
proprietary datasets, do not detail the model inference procedures
used and, thus, do not provide a general systematic view on the
research area. This, in turn, slows down the development and hinders the application of click models. The goal of this tutorial is to
bring together current efforts in the area, summarize the research
performed so far and give a holistic view on existing click models
for web search. More specifically, the aims of this tutorial are the
following:
1. Describe existing click models in a unified way, i.e., using
common notation and terminology, so that different models
can easily be related to each other.
2. Compare commonly used click models, discuss their advantages and limitations and provide a set of recommendations
on their usage.
3. Provide ready-to-use formulas and implementations of existing click models and detail general inference procedures to
facilitate the development of new ones.
4. Give an overview of existing datasets and tools for working
with click models and develop new ones.
5. Provide an overview of click model applications and directions for future development of click models.
Our target audience consists of researchers and developers in information retrieval who are interested in formally capturing user
interactions with search engine result pages, whether for ranking
purposes, to simulate user behavior in a lab setting, or simply to gain
deeper insights in user behavior and interaction data. The tutorial
will be useful as an overview for anyone starting research work in
the area as well as for practitioners seeking concrete recipes.
The tutorial aims to provide a map of an increasingly rich landscape of click models. By the end of the half-day tutorial, attendees

should be familiar with the basic definitions and intuitions of what
we consider to be the core models, with inference tasks for these
models, and with uses of these models. While our presentation is
necessarily formal in places, we make a serious effort to relate the
models, the inference procedures and the applications back to the
core information retrieval task and to web search data by including a
fair number of examples. We hope that this supplies attendees who
are new to the area with effective means to start using click models
in their own research.

DETAILED SCHEDULE

This introductory tutorial consists of two blocks of 1.5 hours.
Each block will incorporate three types of activity: (1) presentation
of the material, (2) live coding sessions, and (3) discussions at the
end of the block. For the coding sessions, we will provide code
examples and data samples. The participants will be able to either
follow the examples on the slides or perform them live along with
the presentation. During the discussion sessions at the end of each
the 1.5 hour blocks, we will offer the participants a number of
quizzes aimed to (self-)assess the comprehension of the presented
material. The schedule of the introductory tutorial is as follows.

5. Recap and Discussion

Break (30 minutes)
Block 2 (1.5 hours)
6. Live Demo: Click Model Inference
In this part, we use samples of publicly available datasets
and open-source software packages to guide the participants
through click model inference in practice. In particular, we
will use an open source package maintained by Markov1 as
well as samples from interaction data shared by Yandex.2

7. Click Model Evaluation
Here, we discuss different ways to evaluate click models
and to compare them to each other. We start with traditional approaches, such as log-likelihood/perplexity evaluation and click-through rate prediction, and then discuss more
application-oriented evaluation methods like NDCG evaluation. The outline of this part is as follows:

3. Basic Click Models
Here, we describe basic click models for web search, starting with the simplest random click model and arriving to
the more sophisticated DCM, DBN and UBM models. We
discuss models’ assumptions, observed and hidden random
variables, models’ parameters and relations between parameters and random variables. This discussion is concluded with
a summary of differences and similarities between the presented models. The following click models will be covered in
this part:

(a) Log-Likelihood and Perplexity Evaluation
(b) Click-Through Rate Prediction Evaluation
(c) Relevance Prediction Evaluation

(a) Random Click Model

8. Data and Tools

(b) Position-Based Model

Here, we discuss publicly available datasets for experimenting with click models. We also describe open-source software
packages and libraries that facilitate working with click models. The outline of this part is as follows:

(c) Cascade Model [3]
(d) User Browsing Model [4]
(e) Dependent Click Model [6]
(f) Click Chain Model [5]

4. Click Model Inference

9. Recap and Discussion

In this part, we describe the process of training click model
parameters from past click observations. We review two main
inference techniques, namely maximum likelihood estimation
(MLE) and the expectation-maximization algorithm (EM).
We then give several examples of MLE and EM inference
for existing click models to support the theory. Finally, we
present the ready-to-use MLE estimates and EM update rules
for the parameters of previously discussed click models. The
detailed plan of this part is as follows:
