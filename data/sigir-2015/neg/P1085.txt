ABSTRACT

Short Bio . Pavel Serdyukov is the Head of Research
Projects at Yandex, where he manages a team of researchers
working in the field of web search, data mining, computer
vision and others. He has published extensively in top-tier
conferences on the topics related to web search, personalization, enterprise/entity search, query log analysis, locationspecific retrieval and recommendation. He co-organized a
number of workshops at SIGIR, was a co-organizer of the
Entity track at TREC 2009-2011, and co-organized a series
of workshops/data mining challenges at WSDM in 2012 –
2014. He has served as a senior PC member at most recent WWW, WSDM and CIKM conferences and was also
the General Chair of ECIR 2013 in Moscow. Before joining
Yandex in 2011, he was a postdoc at Delft University, got
his PhD from Twente University (2009) and his MSc from
Max-Planck Institute for Computer Science (2005).

Yandex is one of the largest Internet companies in Europe,
operating Russia’s most popular search engine, generating
58.6% of all search traffic in Russia (as of April 2015). As
all modern search engines, Yandex increasingly relies on online evaluation methods such as A/B tests and interleaving. These online evaluation methods test various changes
in the search engine by analyzing the changes in the character of its interactions with its users. There are several grand
challenges in online evaluation, including the choice of an
appropriate online metric and the need to deal with the limited number of user interactions available for a search engine
for experimentation. In my talk, I will overview our latest
research on improving the sensitivity of well-known online
metrics, on the discovery of more sensitive and robust online
metrics, on scheduling and early stopping of online experiments.
