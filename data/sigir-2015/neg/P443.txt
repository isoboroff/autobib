ABSTRACT

Keywords

Recommending users with their preferred points-of-interest
(POIs), e.g., museums and restaurants, has become an important feature for location-based social networks (LBSNs),
which beneﬁts people to explore new places and businesses to discover potential customers. However, because users
only check in a few POIs in an LBSN, the user-POI checkin interaction is highly sparse, which renders a big challenge for POI recommendations. To tackle this challenge, in
this study we propose a new POI recommendation approach
called GeoSoCa through exploiting geographical correlations,
social correlations and categorical correlations among users
and POIs. The geographical, social and categorical correlations can be learned from the historical check-in data of
users on POIs and utilized to predict the relevance score of
a user to an unvisited POI so as to make recommendations
for users. First, in GeoSoCa we propose a kernel estimation
method with an adaptive bandwidth to determine a personalized check-in distribution of POIs for each user that naturally models the geographical correlations between POIs.
Then, GeoSoCa aggregates the check-in frequency or rating
of a user’s friends on a POI and models the social check-in
frequency or rating as a power-law distribution to employ
the social correlations between users. Further, GeoSoCa applies the bias of a user on a POI category to weigh the popularity of a POI in the corresponding category and models the weighed popularity as a power-law distribution to
leverage the categorical correlations between POIs. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation for
GeoSoCa using two large-scale real-world check-in data sets
collected from Foursquare and Yelp. Experimental results
show that GeoSoCa achieves signiﬁcantly superior recommendation quality compared to other state-of-the-art POI
recommendation techniques.

INTRODUCTION

As an increasingly popular application of location-based
services, location-based social networks (LBSNs), such as
Foursquare and Yelp, have attracted millions of users to
check in their preferred points-of-interest (POIs), e.g., museums, restaurants and stores, and share their experiences
of visiting these POIs with friends. For example, as of December 2014, Foursquare had over 6 billion check-ins with
millions more every day contributed by more than 55 million
users worldwide. These historical check-in data incorporate
rich information about users and POIs, and thus bring new
opportunities to mine the user visiting preferences for personalized POI recommendations that not only help users
explore new POIs but also beneﬁt for businesses to discover
potential customers.
In the problem of personalized POI recommendations, the
key tasks are to estimate the preference or relevance scores
of a user to her unvisited POIs and return the POIs with the
top-k highest preference scores for the user. Most existing
POI recommendation methods (e.g., [3, 5, 6, 10, 11, 14, 25,
26, 37]) apply the traditional memory-based or model-based
collaborative ﬁltering techniques with the user-POI check-in
matrix to compute the preference score between a user and
an unvisited POI. However, the user-POI check-in matrix is
highly sparse because users have only visited a very small
proportion of POIs in an LBSN. As a result, these methods
usually suﬀer from low recommendation quality.
In this paper, we predict the preference scores of any target user to her unvisited POIs based on three important
types of correlations among the user and unvisited
POIs that can be derived from the historical check-in data
of users on POIs, as depicted in Figure 1. (1) Geographical
correlations. The ﬁrst law of geography [17] states that:
“Everything is related to everything else, but near things are
more related than distant things.” For example, in reality a
person usually visits a POI, e.g., museums, and then travel
to its nearby POIs, e.g., restaurants and stores. That is,
the close POIs have the stronger geographical correlations
than the POIs that are far from each other. Thus, we can
estimate a user’s relevance score for an unvisited POI based
on the geographical correlations between the user’s visited
POIs and unvisited POI. (2) Social correlations. In the
real world, a person may prefer POIs highly recommended

• To model the social correlations, we develop a method
to estimate the social check-in frequency or rating by a
user’s friends to a POI as a power-law distribution that
is learned from the historical check-in data of all users.
Our method is distinct from the current works [2, 4,
20, 21, 23, 27, 30, 31, 34, 35, 36] that derive the similarities between users in terms of their social links and
then integrate them into the traditional collaborative
ﬁltering techniques. (Section 3.3)

Figure 1: Three important types of correlations
by her friends. For instance, they often visit POIs, e.g., museums, restaurants or stores together. In other words, social
friends are more likely to share common interests on POIs
than strangers. Likewise, in LBSNs, users establish social
links with each other to share their experiences of visiting
POIs. Hence, we can compute the relevance score of a user
for an unvisited POI in terms of the social correlations between the user with her friends who have visited the POI.
(3) Categorical correlations. LBSNs often predeﬁne a
universal set of categories and attach each POI to a certain subset of categories. The category of a POI reﬂects its
usual business activities and nature. In reality people have
diﬀerent biases on the categories of POIs: a foodie often
visits restaurants to taste a variety of food, and a tourism
enthusiast usually travels on tourism attractions all over the
world. Accordingly, we can deduce the relevance score of
a user to an unvisited POI based on the categorical correlations in the categories of the user’s visited POIs and the
unvisited POI.
Therefore, we are motivated to propose a new probabilistic approach for point-of-interest recommendations
through exploiting and integrating Geographical, Social
and Categorical correlations, called GeoSoCa. (1) Geographical correlation modeling. With the visited POIs
of a user, we estimate a personalized check-in distribution
over the geographical latitude and longitude coordinates for
the user; the personal check-in distribution naturally models the geographical correlations between the user’s visited
POIs and her unvisited POIs and is able to compute the geographical relevance score of the user to any unvisited POI.
(2) Social correlation modeling. Given an unvisited POI
of a user, we ﬁrst aggregate the check-in frequency or rating
on the POI from her social friends; then the social check-in
frequency (or rating) is transformed into a social relevance
score of the user to the unvisited POI, based on the social
check-in frequency (or rating) distribution that is estimated
from the historical check-in data of all users. (3) Categorical correlation modeling. At ﬁrst, we derive the bias of
a user to a certain category according to her visited POIs;
then the bias is used to weigh the popularity of an unvisited
POI in the corresponding category. Further, the weighed
popularity for the user to the unvisited POI is also mapped
into a categorical relevance score based on the popularity
distribution estimated from the historical check-in data of
all users. The categorical correlation also takes into account
the POI popularity from all users which indicates the quality
of the POI and beneﬁts for POI recommendations.

• To model the categorical correlations, we devise a
method to combine the category bias of a user and the
popularity of a POI into a relevance score between the
user and POI in terms of the estimated popularity distribution from the historical check-in data of all users.
Our method is diﬀerent from the existing works [1,
8, 15, 18, 27, 36] that separately utilize the category
and/or popularity information of POIs. (Section 3.4)
• To the best of our knowledge, our proposed GeoSoCa
is the ﬁrst study to integrate the geographical, social,
categorical and popularity information for POI recommendations. (Section 3.5)
• We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the recommendation accuracy of GeoSoCa using two largescale real-world data sets collected from Foursquare
and Yelp. Experimental results show that GeoSoCa signiﬁcantly outperforms other state-of-the-art POI
recommendation techniques. (Section 4)
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We review
the related work on POI recommendations in Section 2. Our
proposed methods to model geographical, social and categorical correlations are presented in Section 3, followed by
experimental evaluation in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 concludes this paper.

RELATED WORK

This section reviews existing POI recommendation techniques on how they employ the geographical, social, categorical, and popularity information.
POI recommendations using geographical information. Based on the fact that the geographical proximity signiﬁcantly aﬀects the check-in behaviors of users on
the POIs, the geographical information has been intensively
used in POI recommendations. One way is to simply consider the current locations of users to ﬁlter out the POIs that
are far from the users [1, 4, 20, 14]. Another way is to apply the geographical latent factor or topic models to derive
latent features of regions or POIs [7, 8, 12, 16, 25, 26]. The
more sophisticated way is to estimate the geographical correlations of check-in POIs as a common distance distribution

444

for all users, e.g., a multi-center Gaussian distribution [2],
a power-law distribution [9, 13, 15, 22, 23, 28, 29, 32], or
a personalized nonparametric distribution for each user [30,
33, 34]. In particular, the recent works [31, 35] employed the
kernel density estimation method with the ﬁxed bandwidth
to model the geographical check-in distribution of POIs for
each user over the latitude and longitude coordinates. Further, in this paper we develop an adaptive kernel estimation
method to enhance the ability of the obtained check-in distributions to predict the relevance score between a user and
an unvisited POI.
POI recommendations using social information.
Social links between users have also been widely utilized to
improve the quality of location-based recommender systems, since the social friends are more likely to share common
interests on POIs than strangers. Most current works derive
the similarities between users from social links and put them
into the traditional memory-based or model-based collaborative ﬁltering techniques. For example, some literatures [4,
20, 23, 27, 30, 31, 34, 35] seamlessly integrated the similarities of users into the user-based collaborative ﬁltering techniques, while others [2, 21, 36] employed the user similarities
as the regularization terms or weights of latent factor models. In this paper, we contrive a new method to exploit the
social correlations between users by aggregating the checkin frequency or rating of friends to POIs and transforming
them into relevance scores, based on the estimated social
check-in frequency or rating distribution from the historical
check-in data of all users.
POI recommendations using categorical information. The categories of POIs visited by a user implicitly
indicate the activities of the user in the POIs. For instance,
a person checking in a cinema means that she is watching a
movie there. Thus, the category information of POIs is useful for modeling the speciﬁc preference of a user. However,
there are only a few studies that utilize the category information for POI recommendations. Rahimi and Wang [18]
simply identiﬁed the preference of a user to a POI with the
bias of the user to the category of the POI. Bao et al. [1]
calculated the category biases of users to compute the similarity of the users for the user-based collaborative ﬁltering
method. Besides the category biases of users, Ying et al. [27]
also derived the category weights of POIs from the tags annotated on the POIs and then estimated the relevance scores
between users and POIs based on the inner product of the
category biases and weights. Liu et al. [15] clustered POIs
into groups based on their categories, built a user-category
transition matrix instead of user-POI check-in matrix from
the historical check-in data of users, and applied the matrix
factorization technique to discover the next top-k categories
that a user would like to check in. Zhao et al. [36] clustered
users into communities and represented each community as
a weighted category vector, in which each dimension is the
check-in counts of a particular POI category by users in the
community; to apply the user-based collaborative ﬁltering
method, they further computed the similarity of users according to the category vectors of the communities of the
users. Hu et al. [8] leveraged the matrix factorization technique to associate each category with a latent vector and
deuced the relevance score of a user to a POI based on the
latent vectors of the categories of the POI.
POI recommendations using popularity information. The popularity of a POI reﬂects the quality of prod-

ucts or services provided by the POI. For example, a restaurant receiving a lot of visits from customers indicates that
the restaurant provides high-quality foods for its customers.
Thus, the popularity of POIs is also helpful for POI recommendations. Most existing works regard the popularity of
a POI as the universal prior preference of users to the POI.
Speciﬁcally, the study [27] employed the prior preference of
users to unvisited POIs as the weight of the edges between
the users and POIs in the complete bipartite graph, while
other studies utilize the prior preference to adjust the posterior preference that are derived from the geographical information [8, 13, 14, 28]. However, in these studies the prior
preference is not personalized for users and thus in practice
the beneﬁt from the popularity is considerably limited. On
the other hand, the current works [1, 8, 15, 18, 27, 36] separately modeled the eﬀect of the category and popularity
of POIs and may not take full advantage of them for POI
recommendations. In this paper, we devise a new method
to combine the category bias of a user and the popularity of
a POI into a relevance score between the user and POI so
as to personalize the eﬀect of the popularity of the POI on
the user.

MODELING CORRELATIONS FOR POI
RECOMMENDATIONS

In this section, we introduce the research problem with
the required data structures (Section 3.1), model the geographical, social, and categorical correlations (Sections 3.2,
to 3.4), and integrate these three correlations to recommend
POIs to users (Section 3.5).

3.1

Problem Statement

Here we deﬁne the data structures and the research problem in this paper. These data structures can be extracted
from the rich information in an LBSN, incorporating the historical check-in data of users on POIs, social links between
users, the categories of POIs, and the geographical latitude
and longitude coordinates of POIs. Table 1 lists the key
symbols used in this paper.
Definition 1 (Check-in matrix). Given the historical check-in data of users on POIs from an LBSN, we can
easily build a check-in matrix R|U |×|L| , in which each entry

445

Ru,l represents the check-in frequency (e.g., Foursquare) or
rating (e.g., Yelp) of user u ∈ U on location l ∈ L, and U
and L are the sets of users and POIs in the LBSN, respectively. Note that most entries in R are zero, since users have
only visited a very small proportion of POIs in the LBSN.

Definition 2 (Social link matrix). Given the social
links between users from an LBSN, it is easy to construct
a social link matrix S|U |×|U | , in which if there exists a social link between two diﬀerent users u, u′ ∈ U , Su,u′ = 1;
otherwise, Su,u′ = 0.

Definition 3 (Categorical bias matrix). Given
the historical check-in data of users on POIs and the categories of POIs from an LBSN, we construct a categorical
bias matrix B|U |×|C| , in which each entry Bu,c represents
the frequency of user u visiting the POIs that belong to
category c ∈ C, and C is the universal set of categories of
POIs that is often predeﬁned in the LBSN. Note that a
POI could belong to multiple categories.

user check-in data: dense urban areas will have high checkin density and sparsely-populated rural areas will have low
check-in density. To this end, in this paper we adapt the kernel bandwidth to each check-in data point and the adaptive
bandwidth itself is also learned from the underlying checkin data. In general, the adaptive kernel estimation method
includes three steps: pilot estimation, local bandwidth determination, and adaptive kernel estimation for geographical
relevance score.
Step 1: Pilot estimation. First, we ﬁnd a pilot estimation based on the kernel density estimation with a ﬁxed
bandwidth [19]. Let Lu = {l1 , l2 , · · · , ln } be the set of checkin POIs of user u, in which each POI li is associated with
a pair of latitude and longitude (xi , yi ). Speciﬁcally, we
use the frequency or rating of user u on POI li , i.e., Ru,li
(Definition 1), as the weight of li because a higher frequency or rating at a POI indicates that it is more important to
the user. The pilot estimation f˜Geo (l|u) of the check-in distribution of user u on an unvisited POI l is given by

Definition 4 (Popularity matrix). We build a popularity matrix P|C|×|L| , in which each entry Pc,l represents
the popularity of POI l in category c, i.e., the check-in frequency or overall rating of all users on l. Note that most
entries of P are zero, because a POI only belongs to a certain
subset of the universal category set C.
Definition 5 (Geographical coordinates). A POI
l ∈ L is associated with a pair of geographical latitude and
longitude coordinates (x, y).
Problem deﬁnition on POI recommendations. Given the geographical coordinates of POIs, check-in matrix
R|U |×|L| , social link matrix S|U |×|U | , categorical bias matrix B|U |×|C| , and popularity matrix P|C|×|L| , the goal is to
predict the preference score s(u, l) of a user u to an unvisited
POI l (i.e., Ru,l = 0), and then return the top-k POIs with
the highest preference score s(u, l) for the user u.

Distinctly from non-spatial items, such as books and music in conventional recommendation systems, in LBSNs users are required to physically interact with POIs to consume
their oﬀered products or services, e.g., eating food at restaurants or watching movies at cinemas. Thus, the geographical proximity of POIs plays a signiﬁcant role in the check-in
behaviors of users. In other words, the close POIs have the
stronger geographical correlations than the far POIs. Therefore, we can exploit the geographical correlations between a
user’s visited POIs and her unvisited POI to estimate the
relevance score of the user on the unvisited POI. To model the geographical correlations between POIs, we estimate
a personalized check-in distribution over the geographical
coordinates for each user based on her own visited POIs.
Due to the fact that the check-in distributions of users are
diﬀerent from one another, e.g., indoorsy persons like visiting venues around their living areas while outdoorsy persons
prefer exploring new interesting places by traveling around
the world. Accordingly, the current works [30, 31, 34, 35]
learn the distribution form from the check-in POIs of a user
based on a nonparametric estimation method, i.e., the kernel
density estimation with a ﬁxed bandwidth [19]. Nonetheless, the ﬁxed bandwidth does not reﬂect the facts in the

Step 3: Adaptive kernel estimation for geographical relevance score. Finally, with the global bandwidth

local bandwidth hi in Equation (6), the adaptive kernel estimation fGeo (l|u) of the check-in distribution of user u on

social correlations between the user with her friends who
have visited the POI. The process consists of three steps:
social aggregation, distribution estimation of social frequency or rating, and social relevance score computation.
Step 1: Social aggregation. Formally, given a user u
and an unvisited POI l, we aggregate the check-in frequency
or rating xu,l of the user u’s friends (i.e., u′ with Su,u′ = 1)
on the POI l, given by

u′ ∈U

where Ru′ ,l is the check-in frequency or rating of user u′
on POI l (Definition 1) and Su,u′ indicates whether there
exists a social link between users u and u′ (Definition 2).
One can naively regard the social check-in frequency or
rating xu,l as the relevance score between user u and POI
l or simply divide xu,l by the number of friends of u as in
the traditional collaborative ﬁltering techniques. More sophisticatedly, in this study we transform the social check-in
frequency (or rating) into a normalized relevance score based
on the social check-in frequency (or rating) distribution that
is learned from the historical check-in data of all users.
Step 2: Distribution estimation of social frequency or rating. In real-world data sets, the social check-in
frequency or rating random variable x follows a power-law
distribution, the probability density function of which is deﬁned by

It is important to note that: When a check-in POI li lies
in the area with a higher check-in density, it has a larger
pilot estimation f˜Geo (li |u) in Equation (1) or a smaller local
bandwidth hi in Equation (6) that will produce a peak adaptive kernel estimation fGeo (l|u) around li in Equation (8).
In contrast, when a check-in POI li lies in the area with
a lower check-in density, it has a smaller pilot estimation
f˜Geo (li |u) in Equation (1) or a larger local bandwidth hi in
Equation (6) that will generate a smooth adaptive kernel
estimation fGeo (l|u) around li in Equation (8). Therefore,
our adaptive kernel estimation method can improve the predictive ability of the estimated check-in distribution for the
geographical relevance score of user u on an unvisited POI
l, i.e., fGeo (l|u).
Example. Figure 2 depicts the contour line of the geographical check-in distribution estimated through Equation (8) with α = 0.5 for a user who is randomly selected from two publicly available real-world data sets:
Foursquare [6] and Yelp [24], respectively. The estimated
geographical distribution is able to capture the geographical
preference of a speciﬁc user on POIs: the user in Foursquare
visits POIs over the world, with concentration on two areas,
while the user in Yelp checks in POIs only in Arizona of
USA, with focus on three areas.

To observe the real distribution of the social check-in frequency or rating, we conducted analysis on the two publicly

Figure 3 shows that the social check-in frequency or rating
(i.e., the dots) in the two real-world data sets ﬁts a certain
power-law distribution very well (i.e., the line), estimated
through Equations (11) and (12). Thus, modeling the social
check-in frequency or rating as a power-law distribution is
reasonable and eﬀective.
Step 3: Social relevance score computation. The estimated probability density function fSo in Equation (11) is
monotonically decreasing with respect to the social check-in

highly recommended by her friends. In other words, the social correlations between users greatly aﬀect the check-in
behaviors of users to POIs. Likewise, in LBSNs users create
social links with each other to indicate the social friendships
among them. Accordingly, we can deduce the relevance score of a user and an unvisited POI through leveraging the

447

frequency (or rating) x, but the social relevance score should
be monotonically increasing with regard to the social checkin frequency (or rating) because friends share more common
interests on POIs. Thus, we deﬁne the social relevance score
of xu,l in Equation (10) based on the cumulative distribution
function of fSo , given by
∫ xu,l
FSo (xu,l ) =
fSo (z)dz = 1 − (1 + xu,l )1−β ,

Equation (13), the social check-in frequency (or rating) xu,l
is transformed into a social relevance score that reﬂects the
relative position of xu,l in all social check-in frequencies (or
ratings) of users on POIs.

Step 2: Distribution estimation of categorical popularity. As the distribution of the social check-in frequency
or rating, we apply the similar process to build the distribution of the categorical popularity. Formally, we assume
the probability density function of the categorical popularity random variable y, deﬁned by

3.4 Categorical Correlations
In LBSNs, each POI is attached to a few categories. The
category of a POI has a strong indication about what activities happen in the POI and what products or services
are provided by the POI. For instance, a person visiting a
restaurant means that she may have a meal there and a Chinese restaurant indicates that Chinese food will be provided
for customers. In practice, people have shown distinct biases on the categories of POIs, e.g., a foodie likes visiting
restaurants to taste various food and a tourism enthusiast
prefers traveling all over the world to view tourism attractions. Hence, we also can derive the relevance score of a
user to an unvisited POI through exploiting the categorical
correlations between the visited POIs and the unvisited POI
of the user.
In addition, the popularity of a POI reﬂects the quality
of products or services oﬀered by the POI, e.g., a popular restaurant usually indicates that it supplies high-quality
foods. Therefore, it is helpful to utilize the popularity
for POI recommendations. Speciﬁcally, we develop a new
method to combine the category bias of a user and the popularity of a POI into a relevance score between the user and
POI through three steps: weighing popularity by categorical
bias, distribution estimation of categorical popularity, and
categorical relevance score computation.
Step 1: Weighing popularity by categorical bias.
At ﬁrst, we take the bias of a user u to a certain category
c as Bu,c , i.e., the frequency of user u visiting the POIs
that belong to category c (Definition 3). Then, the bias
Bu,c is used to weigh the popularity of an unvisited POI l in
category c, i.e., Pc,l (Definition 4). Correspondingly, we
obtain the categorical popularity yu,l for user u on POI l:
∑
yu,l =
Bu,c · Pc,l ,
(14)

fCa (y) = (γ − 1)(1 + y)−γ , y ≥ 0, γ > 1,

(15)

in which γ can be learned from the categorical bias matrix
B and popularity matrix P:

γ = 1 + |U ||L|

u′ ∈U l′ ∈L

c∈C

(16)
where c∈C Bu′ ,c · Pc,l′ is the categorical popularity of user
u′ on POI l′ .
As depicted in Figure 4, we have also observed that the
categorical popularity (i.e., the dots) in the two real-world
data sets approaches to the power-law distribution (i.e., the
line) that is estimated in terms of Equations (15) and (16).
Thus, these results have validated that the assumption of
the power-law distribution is in accordance with reality.
Step 3: Categorical relevance score computation.
Similarly, the estimated probability density function fCa in
Equation (15) is monotonically decreasing regarding the categorical popularity y; however, the categorical relevance score is monotonically increasing respecting the categorical
popularity, since people prefer the popular POIs that also
meet their categorical biases. To this end, we employ the
cumulative distribution function of fCa to obtain the categorical relevance score of yu,l in Equation (14), given by
∫ yu,l
FCa (yu,l ) =
fCa (z)dz = 1 − (1 + yu,l )1−γ ,
(17)
∑

0

where due to 1 − γ < 0, FCa is an increasing function with
respect to the categorical popularity yu,l . Importantly, the
categorical yu,l is also normalized into a categorical relevance
score, i.e., the relative position of yu,l compared to other
categorical popularities of users on POIs.

c∈C

where C is the predeﬁned universal set of categories in an
LBSN. A larger value of yu,l indicates that the category of
POI l is more satisﬁed with the bias of user u and the POI
l is more popular to the general public.
One may naively consider the categorical popularity yu,l
as the relevance score between user u and POI l or simply
normalize the categorical bias Bu,c in advance. Nevertheless, in this research the categorical popularity of a user to
an unvisited POI is sophisticatedly mapped into a relevance
score based on the distribution of the categorical popularity
that is learned from the historical check-in data of all users.

3.5

POI Recommendations

Finally, we integrate the geographical, social and categorical relevance scores, given by Equations (8), (13) and (17),
into a uniﬁed preference score s(u, l) for user u to unvisited
POI l based on the product rule:
s(u, l) = fGeo (l|u) · FSo (xu,l ) · FCa (yu,l ).

(18)

The top-k POIs l with the highest score s(u, l) are recommended to user u. It is worth mentioning that the product

4. EXPERIMENTS

4.2

In this section, we conduct intensive experiments to evaluate the recommendation quality of GeoSoCa, compared
to state-of-the-art POI recommendation techniques. We
present experimental settings in Section 4.1 and analyze experimental results in Section 4.2.

Experimental Results

We compare our GeoSoCa with the state-of-the-art POI
recommendation techniques in Section 4.2.1, study the recommendation quality of the three components in GeoSoCa
in Section 4.2.2, and investigate the eﬀect of sensitivity parameter α in Section 4.2.3.

4.1 Experimental Settings

4.2.1

Two real data sets. We use the two publicly available large-scale real check-in data sets that have been studied in Section 3 and were crawled from Foursquare [6] and
Yelp [24]. Note that the Foursquare data set provides the
check-in frequencies of users to POIs and the Yelp data set
oﬀers the ratings of users on POIs. Table 2 shows the statistics of the data sets and Figure 5 depicts the distribution
of POIs over the world from Foursquare while the greater
Phoenix, Arizona, USA from Yelp. The half of check-in data with earlier check-in times are used as the training set
and the other half of check-in data are used as the testing
set, because in practice we can only utilize the past check-in
data to predict the future check-in events.
Evaluated techniques. Our proposed method, i.e.,
GeoSoCa, is compared with the state-of-the-art POI recommendation techniques including:

Method Comparison

Figures 6 and 7 depict the recommendation accuracy of
our GeoSoCa compared to the state-of-the-art POI recommendation techniques with respect to the number k of POIs
recommended for users and the number n of POIs visited
by users in the training set. The trends in the precision and
recall of all evaluated methods are intuitive. For example, as
k increases, the precision gets lower and the recall becomes
higher, because recommending more POIs for users can discover more POIs that the users would like to check in, but
some recommended POIs are less possible to be visited by
the users. With the increase of n, the precision and recall
gradually raise, since all methods can learn better recommendation models through using more check-in data.
The absolute accuracy of POI recommendation techniques
is usually not high, because the density of user-POI check-in
matrix is pretty low as shown in Table 2, but POI recommendation techniques will perform better as more check-in
data are collected. This phenomenon has been repeatedly observed in previous works (e.g., [23, 31]). Instead, we
concentrate on contrasting the relative accuracy of the evaluated POI recommendation techniques.
USG. This method [23] linearly integrates user preference
from user-based collaborative ﬁltering, social inﬂuence from
social collaborative ﬁltering, and geographical inﬂuence from
a common distance distribution for all users, but it does not
take into account the category and popularity information
of POIs. Moreover, it is not advisable to apply the universal
linear weights for user preference, social inﬂuence, and geographical inﬂuence, since some users are aﬀected by social

friends more and other users may rely on the geographical
inﬂuence more. According to Figures 6 and 7, USG subsequently gives the third worst recommendation result on the
Foursquare data set and the worst recommendation accuracy on the Yelp data set that has two time lower density than
the Foursquare data set, as depicted in Table 2.
CoRe. This method [31] employs the social inﬂuence in
the same way as USG, but it models a personalized geographical check-in distribution for each user and combines the social and geographical inﬂuences by a more robust product
rule rather than using the linear sum rule. CoRe accordingly outperforms USG to some extent as depicted in Figures 6
and 7. However, CoRe still misses the category and popularity information of POIs and estimates the geographical
check-in distribution based on the kernel density estimation
method with a ﬁxed bandwidth. As a result, in general it
only generates the third best recommendation precision and
recall on the two data sets.
DRW. This method [27] adopts a dynamic random walk
model to fuse the social links between users and the category and popularity information of POIs, but it does not
consider the unique characteristic of POI recommendations for LBSNs, i.e., the inﬂuence of geographical information
of POIs on the check-in behaviors of users. Consequently,
DRW reports the lowest recommendation accuracy on the
Foursquare data set, as shown in Figures 6(a), 6(b), 7(a),
and 7(b). Interestingly, on the Yelp data set with lower
density in Figures 6(c), 6(d), 7(c), and 7(d), DRW is supe-

rior to USG through taking full advantage of the popularity
of POIs to deal with the sparsity of data.
LCARS. This method [25, 26] exploits the well-known
topic model, i.e., latent Dirichlet allocation, to infer the personal interest of users and local preference (i.e., local specialty) of regions (e.g., a city). The personal interest or local
preference is represented as a mixture of topics, in which
each topic is a distribution over POIs and is learned from
the check-in data and categories of POIs. Nonetheless, LCARS ignores the geographical and social characteristics in
the check-in behaviors of users on POIs, so it also suﬀers
from the low recommendation accuracy as in DRW.
NCPD. This method [8] utilizes matrix factorization to
derive a latent factor vector for each user, POI and category,
a geographical bias for each user, and a popularity bias for
each POI. Then, NCPD computes the preference score of a
user to a POI based on (1) the latent factor vectors of the
user, the categories that the POI belongs to, and the neighborhoods of the POI, (2) the user’s geographical bias, and
(3) the POI’s popularity bias. Accordingly, NCPD shows the
second best recommendation result as depicted in Figures 6
and 7. However, its improvement is very limited in comparison to CoRe, because NCPD simply regards the geographical
and popularity inﬂuence as a bias, instead of modeling them
as a geographical or popularity distribution.
GeoSoCa. Our proposed GeoSoCa always exhibits the
best recommendation quality in terms of both precision and
recall. In particular, it achieves the signiﬁcant improvement compared to the second best recommendation technique

NCPD. The reason is threefold: (1) GeoSoCa models the
geographical check-in distribution using the adaptive kernel estimation method, in which the bandwidth is adaptive
to each check-in data point rather than using a ﬁxed bandwidth. This adaptive method can capture the real geographical check-in patterns of users on POIs, e.g., high check-in
density in dense urban areas and low check-in density in
sparsely-populated rural areas. (2) GeoSoCa exploits the
social check-in frequency or rating of friends based on the
power-law distribution which is learned from the historical
check-in data of users. This method can eﬀectively transform the social check-in frequency or rating into a reasonable relevance score and is superior to the traditional social
collaborative ﬁltering. (3) GeoSoCa takes full advantage of
the category and popularity information through seamlessly
combining the categorical bias of users and the popularity
of POIs into a reasonable relevance score based on the estimated power-law distribution from check-in data of users.

α = 0, the adaptive local bandwidth is degraded to the ﬁxed
bandwidth that has nothing to do with the check-in data.
As a result, the precision and recall decrease. (3) In contrast, when the value of α becomes higher from 0.6 to 1, the
local bandwidth gets more sensitive to the pilot estimation
in Equation (6), i.e., the local bandwidth is prone to overﬁtting the check-in data. Thus, the recommendation quality
deteriorates as well.

4.2.2 Study on Three Components in GeoSoCa
Here we study the three components of GeoSoCa including geographical, social and categorical correlations, written
as Geo, So and Ca, respectively. Figure 8 depicts the recommendation accuracy of the three components based on
Equations (8), (13) and (17), respectively. We have two observations: (1) All the three components play a key role in
GeoSoCa for POI recommendations and they are competitive to one another. For example, So outperforms Geo and
Ca on the Foursquare data set, but reversely on the Yelp
data set. And the performance of Geo and Ca is similar on
the two data sets. (2) The integration of the three components is helpful for enhancing the recommendation quality,
since GeoSoCa is signiﬁcantly superior to each component,
i.e., Geo, So and Ca. The behind reason is that in practice
people are aﬀected by the geographical, social and categorical correlations in varying degrees; it is unable to model the
check-in behaviors of all users by considering only one type
of correlations. Thus, POI recommendations should take
full advantage of various types of useful information implied
the check-in behaviors of users on POIs.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

This paper proposes a new POI recommendation approach
GeoSoCa by exploiting three types of correlations that are
derived from the historical check-in data of users on POIs.
(1) GeoSoCa uses the kernel estimation with an adaptive
bandwidth to model the geographical correlations between
POIs as a personalized geographical check-in distribution of
POIs for each user. (2) GeoSoCa models the social checkin frequency or rating as a power-law distribution to utilize
the social correlations between users. (3) GeoSoCa models
the popularity of POI categories as a power-law distribution
to employ the categorical correlations between POIs. The
experimental results on the two large-scale real-world data
sets collected from Foursquare and Yelp show that GeoSoCa signiﬁcantly improves the recommendation accuracy of
the current state-of-the-art POI recommendation approaches. As a part of our future work, we plan to extend our
GeoSoCa by integrating the sentiment or opinion extracted from the textual reviews of users commenting POIs to
improve the recommendation quality of GeoSoCa.

4.2.3 Effect of Sensitivity Parameter α
Figure 9 depicts the eﬀect of the sensitivity parameter α
in Equation (6) on the precision and recall of GeoSoCa in
the two real-world data sets; note that β and γ are not free
parameters and are learned from the check-in data. We have
the following three observations: (1) The optimal value of α
usually lies between 0.4 and 0.6 that generates the highest
recommendation accuracy. (2) As the value of α varies from
0.4 to 0, the local bandwidth gets less sensitive to the pilot
