ABSTRACT

In this paper we are interested in social signals associated
to web resources. Nowadays, web pages include different
social network buttons where users can express if they support or recommend content [1]. In this paper, we assume
that, in addition to estimating a priori significance based on
simply counting signals related to the resource [3], signals
diversity associated to a resource can be also an index that
indicates a resource interest beyond a social network or a
community. The research questions addressed in this paper
are the following:

Social signals (users’ actions) associated with web resources
(documents) can be considered as an additional information that can play a role to estimate a priori importance of
the resource. In this paper, we are particularly interested
in: first, showing the impact of signals diversity associated
to a resource on information retrieval performance; second,
studying the influence of their social networks origin on their
quality. We propose to model these social features as prior
that we integrate into language model. We evaluated the
effectiveness of our approach on IMDb dataset containing
167438 resources and their social signals collected from several social networks. Our experimental results are statistically significant and show the interest of integrating signals
diversity in the retrieval process.

While considerable work has been done in the context
of social IR there is still a lack of user studies that would
analyze the impact of users’ actions diversity in a resource
from diverse viewpoints. Major existing works [3, 6, 10,
11] focus on how to improve IR effectiveness by exploiting
the users’ actions and their underlying social network. For
instance, Chelaru et al. [6] study the impact of social signals (like, dislike, comment) on the effectiveness of search
on YouTube. In [3, 4], the authors show the impact of different time-sensitive signals taken into account individually
and grouped as social properties without considering their
diversity in the resource.
Our work is distinguished from the state of art. Our approach is based on signals diversity in the resource to improve relevance ranking of conventional text search. We exploit various signals extracted from different social networks.
We note that in previous works, diversity has been applied
only to the textual content of the document [2] [16].
Our goal is to estimate the significance of the resource
by taking into account signals diversity into the resource.
These sources of evidence are incorporated into language
model that provides a theoretical founded way to take into
account the notion of a priori probability of a document.

INTRODUCTION

Majority of information retrieval systems (SIR) exploit
two classes of sources of evidence to rank documents in response to the user query. The first class, the most exploited,
is dependent on the query, it concerns the term statistics
such as term frequency, distribution of term in documents.
The second class concerns query-independent factors, which
measures a kind of quality or importance of the document.
Among these factors, the number of incoming links to a document [12], PageRank [5], topical locality [7], the presence
of URL [17], document authors [13] and social signals [11].

SOCIAL SIGNALS DIVERSITY

Our approach consists in exploiting social signals and their
diversity as a priori knowledge to take them into account in
retrieval model. We rely on language model to model signals
diversity as a prior probability.

3.1

Px (D) =

Px (ai |C) is estimated using maximum-likelihood:

Notation

P (D|Q) = P (D) · P (Q|D) = P (D) ·

P (wi |D)

We believe that the diversity of signals in a resource is
an index that may indicate an interest beyond a social network or a community. Diversity and quantitative distribution of social signals in a resource may be considered as
factors of relevance, i.e., a resource dominated by a single
signal should be disadvantaged versus a resource with an
equitable distribution of the signals. By applying diversity
index of Shannon-Wiener [14], the corresponding formula is
as follows:

Diversitys (D) = −

(1)

DiversitysEquit (D) =
Where:

According to our previous approach [3], the priors are estimated by a simply counting of actions performed on the
resource. We assume that signals are independent, the general formula is the following:

Px (D) = 

EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION

To validate our approach, we conducted a series of experiments on IMDb dataset. We evaluated the impact of signals
diversity by combining it with language model.

The a priori probability Px (D) is estimated using the formula 4 multiplied by the diversity factor. The corresponding
formula is as follows:

Px (D) =

Px (ai ) · log(Px (ai ))

Where P (ai ) is defined above, and m represents the total
number of signals.
The Shannon index is often accompanied by Pielou evenness index [14] :

P (D) is a document prior, i.e. query-independent feature
representing the probability of seeing the document. The
document prior is useful for representing and incorporating
other sources of evidence in the retrieval process. wi represents words of query Q. Estimating of P (wi |D) can be
performed using different models (Jelineck Mercer, Dirichlet). The main contribution in this paper is how to estimate
P (D) by exploiting social signals.

Social information that we exploit within the framework of
our model can be represented by 4-tuple <U, R, A, SN>
where U, R, A, SN are finite sets of instances: Users, Resources, Actions and Social Networks.
Resources. We consider a collection C ={D1 , D2 ,...Dn }
of n documents. Each document (resource) D can be a Web
page, video or other type of Web resources. We assume
that resource D can be represented both by a set of textual
keywords Dw ={Dw1 , Dw2 ,...Dwz } and a set of social actions
A performed on this resource, Da ={Da1 , Da2 ,...Dam }.
Actions. We assume a set A={a1 , a2 ,...am } of m actions
that users can perform on the resources. These actions represent the relation between users U ={u1 , u2 ,...uh } and resources C. For instance, on Facebook, users can perform the
following actions on resources: like, share, comment.
Social Properties. We consider a set X ={P opularity,
Reputation} of 2 social properties that characterize a document D. Each property is quantified by a specific actions
group. These properties are modeled as a priori probability.

Description of Test Dataset

We used a collection IMDb documents provided by INEX1 .
Each document describes a movie, and is represented by a
set of metadata, and has been indexed according to keywords
extracted from fields [3]. For each document, we collected

To avoid Zero probability, we smooth Px (ai ) by collection

of different social networks have found that a resource is
useful, then it is more likely that other users will find these
resources useful too.

Results and Discussions

4.3

We conducted experiments with models based only on
content of documents (Lucene Solr model3 and Hiemstra
language model without prior [9]), as well as approaches
combining content and social properties as a priori probabilities of document. We note that the best value of µ ∈ [90, 100]
The results are listed in table 3.
Table 3 summarizes the results of precisions@k for k ∈
{10, 20}, nDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain)
and MAP (Mean Average Precision). In [3, 4], authors have
already shown that taking into account the social characteristics without considering diversity improves IR compared to
models based only on the topical relevance. In order to check
the significance of the results, we performed the Student test
[8] and attached * (strong significance against Baseline (A)
and (B)) and ** (very strong significance against Baseline
(A) and (B)) to the performance number of each row in the
table 3 when the p-value < 0.05 and p-value < 0.01 confidence level, respectively.
Before discussing the results we highlight that first we
performed a correlation analysis by using the Spearman’s
correlation coefficient between signals diversity scores in the
documents and their relevance. We found that the diversity
represents a positive correlation with the relevance (Spearman’s rho = 0.19), this result has aroused our interest and
encourage us to exploit the diversity in our IR model. Table
3 (D) lists the results obtained by the integration of the signals diversity in the document. We notice that the NDCG
and Precisions are generally better than the baseline listed
in Table 3 (C) part when diversity is ignored.
We also notice that the both results are much more better
than those obtained by topical models (Baseline (A) With2

Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis

To better understand the effect of these social signals on
the selection of relevant documents, we analyze their distribution in the all documents returned by 30 topics.
According to Table 4 we notice that the average frequency
of the signals in the relevant documents is higher compared
to irrelevant documents (ex. the average of like is 362 actions
in the relevant documents while in irrelevant documents is
61 actions). We also note that the signals coming from Facebook capture the highest number of relevant documents (see
Figure 2), knowing that they are many in irrelevant documents but with a much smaller average. This is due to
the engagement rate on Facebook and its dynamic growth
[1]. Therefore, the distinction between relevant documents
and irrelevant documents is much more sensitive to signal
frequency, i.e., relevant documents are characterized by a
very high number of Facebook signals compared to the irrelevant documents (see Figure 1). The signals tweet and
+1 come in second position with an average frequency, respectively, 97 and 29 actions in the relevant documents (see
Figure 1). The signal of Delicious (Bookmark) is the weakest criterion among these signals, it appears in 429 relevant
documents with an average frequency of 13 actions per document only. Concerning the signal of LinkedIn, we note
that 95% of its actions of share are condensed in 601 relevant documents with an average frequency of 67 actions
per document. However, the number of relevant documents
captured by Linkedin share signal is very low compared to
that captured by Facebook signals, this is due to LinkedIn
engagement rate which is very low compared to Facebook,
but LinkedIn share signal represents the most reliable source
in terms of trust compared to other social signals. Therefore, we can say that the presence of this signal, whatever
its frequency in a document represents a relevance index.

Finally, according to this preliminary statistical study, we
observe that each social network has its own specific influence on the quality of its social signals. The quality of
signals, provided by Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and Delicious, in a document depend on their frequencies, the more
the signals are frequent on the resource, the more its a priori importance increases. However, the LinkedIn signal does
not only depend on its frequency in the document because it
has in itself a power of mature trust compared to the other
signals. This amounts to the maturity of LinkedIn users who
are well reputed compared to other social networks users.

CONCLUSION

We proposed in this paper a search model based on users’
actions associated with a document. We proposed to estimate a social priors of a document by considering signals diversity. The proposed model is based on language
model that incorporates this a priori knowledge. Experimental evaluation conducted on IMDb dataset shows that
taking into account these social features in a textual model
improves the quality of returned search results. Finally, to
investigate the influence of social networks on the quality of
signals, we developed a statistical study on the distribution
of social signals for each social network in both relevant and
irrelevant documents.
For future work, we plan to address some limitations of the
current study. We plan to integrate other social data into
proposed approach. Further experiments on another dataset
