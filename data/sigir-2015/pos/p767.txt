ABSTRACT

to a “tipping point” beyond which behaviors and perceptions
change [15]. User sensitivity to delay varies across individuals, the average speed of the system used [1], and how the
information is presented [15]. It has also been found that
searchers who experience both query and document response
delays view fewer documents, but mark a higher percentage
as relevant, although the delay had no impact on the number
of queries issued, the number of documents marked relevant,
the depth of results inspected or search accuracy [8].
Although there has been a resurgence of interest in the impact of search system delay on user experience, a long line of
research precedes this interest. In 1968, Miller [9] described
system response times exceeding two seconds as changing
the character of “man-computer conversational transactions”
and provided a taxonomy of acceptable response times depending on the type and complexity of system interactions
and the extent to which the response delay would disrupt
the user’s task. Since this early work, researchers have found
that perceived wait time and the impact of delays can be reduced by informing users of the system response status [11],
incrementally loading pages [2], or displaying filler text or
images [6] while the system is processing its response.
While system delays have been investigated in IIR, one
variable that has not been investigated much is time pressure. Research on time pressured decision-making has found
that people adapt under time pressure: they may spend less
time in each decision stage, spend less time processing individual pieces of information, accelerate the pace of the task
or information processing, or even satisfice in their decisions
[12]. Time has been shown to be an important contextual
factor in search [13]; however, the impact of time pressure
on search behaviors and perceptions is less well understood.
Recent studies have have shown when searchers have less
time to complete tasks, they have lower perceptions of their
search performance [7] and task completion [17], less satisfaction with results [7, 17] and less knowledge gained [7].
Searchers also report lower pre-task search confidence [7] and
more negative affect [7] and stress [17]. Time pressure has
also been found to impact search satisfaction even when the
same amount of time was given to complete tasks [4]. Finally, Mishra et al. [10] found dissatisfaction among people
who searched for time-critical information.
In this paper, we report preliminary results of a study
investigating the impact of time pressure, system delays
and interaction effects on search behaviors and user experience. We present the results of our analyses of interaction
measures as well as time pressure and delay manipulation
checks.

We report preliminary results of the impact of time pressure and system delays on search behavior from a laboratory
study with forty-three participants. To induce time pressure, we randomly assigned half of our study participants
to a treatment condition where they were only allowed five
minutes to search for each of four ad-hoc search topics. The
other half of the participants were given no task time limits.
For half of participants’ search tasks (n=2), five second delays were introduced after queries were submitted and SERP
results were clicked. Results showed that participants in
the time pressure condition queried at a significantly higher
rate, viewed significantly fewer documents per query, had
significantly shallower hover and view depths, and spent significantly less time examining documents and SERPs. We
found few significant differences in search behavior for system delay or interaction effects between time pressure and
system delay. These initial results show time pressure has
a significant impact on search behavior and suggest the design of search interfaces and features that support people
who are searching under time pressure.

INTRODUCTION

Recently, increased attention has been paid to how system delays impact search behavior and the user experience
in the context of interactive information retrieval (IIR) [1,
8, 15, 16]. Users of search systems with slower query response times have been found to have lower perceptions of
system usability and helpfulness [1]. Studies examining system delays have found users are tolerant of search delays up

METHOD

a pre-search questionnaire, conducted their search and then
completed a post-search questionnaire. After conducting all
four searches, participants completed an exit questionnaire.
Following this, the researcher returned to the room for a
final interview and debriefing.

We conducted a laboratory experiment where we manipulated task time limit and system response time. To manipulate task time limit, half of the participants were given an
unexpected task time limit just before they started the experimental search tasks. This time limit was presented via
pop-up message after they completed the practice task and
informed them they had only 5 minutes to complete each experimental search task (Figure 1). These instructions were
intended to simulate a situation in which an urgent notification changes one’s expectations about the time available
to complete a task. The 5 minute time limit represented
approximately half of the mean task completion times from
a prior study [5] where different participants used the same
system to complete three of the same tasks without time limits. The system tracked the time, and after participants had
been searching for 5 minutes, popped-up another message
indicating time was up.

2.1 Scenario and Tasks
Following Borlund’s [3] guidelines, search tasks were situated in the context of a project in which a research team
needs to compare news coverage about four topics during the
(consecutive) U.S. presidential terms of Clinton, Bush and
Obama. Participants were told their job was to examine
news during Clinton’s second term, 1996-2000, which corresponded to the date range of the test collection [18]. We
wanted the scenario to provide participants with a rationale
for searching articles from this time period and to make this
characteristic of the collection salient to help ground participants’ relevance judgments. The scenario indicated that
participants should find 8-12 articles per topic.
We selected topics from the collection with contemporary
relevance where prior studies have reported that participants
found the tasks at least moderately interesting and difficult
[5]. We aimed to minimize potential variability in interest
and difficulty in order to examine the impact of our independent variables. Four topics were used: wildlife extinction
(347), journalist risks (354), piracy (367) and population
growth (435). Participants were presented with the topic
descriptions before each search.
To minimize order effects, we created a set of 24 topic
rotations. We assigned the topic rotations to time limit and
delay order combinations such that each topic rotation was
used twice: once in each time limit condition and once in
each delay order. We randomly assigned participants to time
limit, delay order and topic rotation.

Figure 1: Task time limit instructions
Participants who were not given a task time limit were not
provided with any instructions regarding the amount of time
to spend on each task, although all participants were aware
that the experimental session would last 1hr and 15min. If
these participants were still searching after 1hr and 5min
(i.e., with approximately 10 minutes remaining in the experimental session), we stopped them so they could complete
the exit questionnaire and interview. Based on our previous
experiences, we did not expect we would need to do this;
however, this occurred in seven cases. To minimize time
pressure caused by researcher presence [14], the researcher
was stationed in an adjacent room while participants completed the study.
System response time was a within-subjects variable with
two levels: delay and no delay. Participants completed two
tasks in which we introduced 5 second delays after they submitted queries and clicked on SERP results and two tasks in
which the system was not delayed. We selected a 5 second
delay based on prior research which indicated that a delay of
4 seconds changed behaviors but not attitudes and is usually
considered acceptable to users (delays of 7-10 seconds have
been found to be unacceptable by users [15]). We presented
delays in 2 orders: half of the participants experienced delays during their first and third tasks while the other half
experienced delays during their second and fourth tasks.
The basic procedure was as follows. Participants were first
shown the experiment instructions on screen including the
simulated work task scenario and then completed a practice
task to become familiar with the system; we did not impose a time limit or system delay during the practice task.
Once participants completed the practice task, those with
a task time limit were shown the instructions in Figure 1
before being presented with their first search task. For each
search task, participants were shown the topic, completed

2.2 Search Questionnaires
Our search questionnaires measured several constructs including system usability, task difficulty, metacognitive actions and satisfaction. Several items functioned as manipulation checks to see if participants felt time pressure and
noticed system delays (see Table 1). Participants responded
to these items with a 7-point scale (1 = strongly disagree,
7 = strongly agree). In this paper, we only present items
related to the manipulation checks and will analyze the additional measures in future work.

2.3 Search System
All participants used the same search system which resembled a standard search engine. The Whoosh IR Toolkit
was used as the core of the retrieval system, with BM25
as the retrieval algorithm, using standard parameters, but
with an implicit ANDing of query terms to restrict the retrieval set. Only a portion of the collection was indexed
to ensure that the natural response time of the system was
quick and constant. This was to control the effects of both
the natural and experimental delays as much as possible.
The documents included in the index consisted of all the
TREC pooled documents for the given topics, along with
the top 100 documents retrieved from the full index given
a set of user generated queries from a past study (approximately 100-200 queries per topic). In total, over 200,000
documents were indexed. In all conditions, the search system displayed a spinning wheel when it was busy.

2.4 Participants

not participants experienced delays; in fact, these measures
were very similar in these two conditions.
When we examine actions per query, we see those who experienced the task time limit examined search results more
shallowly. They viewed fewer SERPs and documents and
also did not navigate as deeply in the search results list.
All of these differences were statistically significant. Participants with a task time limit also spent significantly less time
viewing documents and SERPs. Although the trend was for
participants to view fewer SERPs and documents per query
when they experienced delays and not go as deeply in the
search results list, these differences were not significant. Participants spent significantly more time viewing documents
for delayed tasks, but they spent roughly equal amounts of
time viewing SERPs for their delayed and non-delayed tasks.
With respect to performance, there were no differences
in participants’ save rates (% viewed marked relevant) according to time limit or response time conditions. Although
we have not examined the content of the documents participants saved, we examined whether participants met the
scenario goal of finding 8-12 relevant articles. This goal was
achieved more often for tasks where no task time limit was
present (96% vs. 84% of tasks) and for tasks where no delays were present (92% vs. 86% of tasks). Only 76% of tasks
with both a delay and a task time limit had at least 8 pages
marked relevant compared to 100% of tasks with no task
time limit and delay.

Forty-five people from a major research university participated including undergraduate students (n=13), graduate
students (n=8) and staff (n=22) representing many different majors and occupations. Participants ranged in age from
18-59 years (M=32.1, SD=12.8) and 31 were female. Participants were compensated $20 USD.

RESULTS

We analyzed 163 tasks completed by 43 participants using
a mixed ANOVA. We excluded data from 2 participants with
no task time limit who spent most of the time completing a
single search task, 7 tasks where participants with no task
time limit were stopped in their third task or final task, and
2 tasks where participants accidentally ended the tasks by
pressing the wrong button.

3.1 Time and Delay
We conducted a series of manipulation checks to make
sure our experimental manipulations were successful. We
found those with the task time limit reported feeling significantly more time pressure, a greater need to work fast and
more rushed (Table 1). We found significant differences in
perceived quickness of SERP and document display between
the delay conditions. We found no interaction effects, but
note a significant effect of delay on perceived time pressure.
We examined task completion times and found significant
effects of task time limit and system delay on the total task
time as shown in Table 1. The introduction of time limits and system delays complicates comparison of interaction
measures as the total delay experienced by any one person
is a function of the number of queries issued and documents
viewed by this person. For this reason, we also examined adjusted task times where we subtracted the cumulative delay
experienced by each participant for each task from the total
task time; we found significant main effects of time limit and
no main effect of delay. Interaction effects were significant
(F(2,118)=7.03, p<.01).
To check the delay manipulation, we examined query and
document processing times (in seconds). As expected, we
found no significant differences in organic system response
times and significant differences in the mean total processing
time (organic + delay) according to delay condition. It took
longer for the system to return requests for tasks with delay
condition (query: M=5.92, SD=0.96; document: M=5.20,
SD=1.16) than for tasks without delay (query: M=0.94,
SD=0.84; document: M=0.29, SD=0.34). We found no
main effect for time limit or interaction effects.

4. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
We investigated the impact of time pressure and system
delays on search behaviors. Results showed participants who
were given task time limits queried at a significantly higher
rate, viewed significantly fewer documents per query, had
significantly shallower hover and view depths, and spent significantly less time SERPs. They also spent significantly less
time examining documents, and presumably, making judgments about which documents to save.
We did not find significant differences in search behavior
with respect to system delays beyond the time spent completing the task (total and adjusted) and the time spent per
document. While the delay was noticed by most participants, it did not significantly impact their search behaviors.
These findings are consistent with other studies [1, 8]. Of
course, it is likely that larger delay times would produce
different results: Taylor et al. [15] found a tipping point
between 7 and 11 seconds for behavioral impacts but some
changes to satisfaction were observed at lower thresholds.
Whether the delay is consistent or intermittent also seems
to play a role [1]. Further analysis of the questionnaires and
debriefings will likely provide additional insight about how
time pressure and system delays impacted the user experience.
Interestingly, we found considerable variability in the task
completion times for those without task time limits and
two participants, whose data were excluded, used nearly
the entire experimental session to search for a single task.
For those tasks included in analyses, task completion times
ranged from 1.76min to 36.27min. For 10 tasks, the total
task completion time exceeded 15min. These variations surprised us because they differ considerably from what we have
observed in previous laboratory studies, where the general
challenge is often to create tasks that will require sustained
interaction.

3.2 Search Behaviors
Table 1 shows the means and standard deviations of participants’ search behaviors by time limit and response time
condition. With one exception, there were no significant
interaction effects, so we only report main effects. We normalized time-based measures to facilitate comparison. The
adjusted rate-based measures reflect the number of queries,
document views and documents marked relevant per minute
using adjusted times; that is, total time minus time spent in
delay as in Taylor, Dennis & Cummings [15]. While participants who experienced a task time limit had higher rates
of querying, document viewing and marking documents as
relevant, only the difference for query rate was significant.
There were no significant differences according to whether or

While preliminary, our initial results open a new line of
inquiry into how time pressure impacts search behaviors and
how search tools might be designed to support people who
are searching under time pressure. For example, interface
features that make it easier for people to query, assess relevance and monitor progress might be especially beneficial.
Displaying fewer results per SERP might also help keep people who are searching under time pressure stay focused.
