ABSTRACT

tion of the Web [30] that can be categorized with respect to
its changes of 1) content and structure, and 2) user querying behavior. The content of the Web changes constantly
over time, e.g., documents are added, modified or deleted
continuously. Similarly, the link structure of the Web also
evolves [16]. Content and structure changes affect basic processes like crawling and indexing, but also the computation
of graph-based authority measures that typically are used
for document ranking.
Another web evolution aspect is the change of user querying behavior, which can be observable at least in two ways.
First, search traffic for particular queries varies over time
and presents certain temporal patterns, such as, spikes, periodicity (e.g., weekly or monthly), seasonality and trends [32].
Second, many queries are time-sensitive, which contain underlying temporal information needs that do not exhibit
a temporal pattern in search streams [38]. Understanding
temporal search intent is a challenging task before applying
an appropriate time-aware ranking method.
Temporal IR has received a large share of attention in
the last decade. For example, there are at least two main
research challenges related to temporal IR that have been organized recently: the TREC Temporal Summarization Track
and Temporalia (Temporal Information Access) [24]. In
this tutorial, we will give a comprehensive overview of the
important aspects of temporal information retrieval, which
intends to support participants with basic knowledge who
want to get acquainted with the research area, and for more
advanced researchers aiming to understand in more detail
this field of research. This tutorial complements previous
work, such as, an overview of challenges and opportunities
in temporal IR [3], a tutorial [41], and a recent survey [14]
as follows:

The study of temporal dynamics and its impact can be
framed within the so-called temporal IR approaches, which
explain how user behavior, document content and scale vary
with time, and how we can use them in our favor in order
to improve retrieval effectiveness.
This half-day tutorial will outline research issues with respect to temporal dynamics, and provide a comprehensive
overview of temporal IR approaches, essentially regarding
processing dynamic content, temporal information extraction, temporal query analysis, and time-aware retrieval and
ranking. The tutorial is structured into two sessions. During the first session, we will explain the general and wide
aspects associated to temporal dynamics by focusing on the
web domain, from content and structural changes to variations of user behavior and interactions. We will begin with
temporal indexing and query processing. Next step, we will
explain current approaches to time-aware retrieval and ranking, which can be classified into different types based on
two main notions of relevance with respect to time, namely,
recency-based ranking, and time-dependent ranking.
In the latter session, we will describe research issues centered on determining the temporal intent of queries, and
time-aware query enhancement, e.g., temporal relevance feedback, and time-aware query reformulation. In addition, we
present applications in related research areas, e.g., exploration, summarization, and clustering of search results, as
well as future event retrieval and prediction. To this end,
we conclude our tutorial and outline future directions.
This tutorial targets graduate students, researchers and
practitioners in the field of information retrieval. The goal
is to provide an overview as well as an important context
that enables further research on and practical applications
within this area.

Temporal Indexing and Query Processing

returns events instead of documents, whereas time-aware
ranking methods use a very simple notion of events.

Evolving web content has an impact on several components of a search engine. In this section, we revisit three
main building blocks of the search system, namely crawling,
indexing, and query processing.
We will explain how to index versioned archives, which requires even more complex indexing and maintenance procedures. Several works have been proposed in the area of versioned indexing and query processing [7, 10, 13, 21, 37, 53].
Two general approaches to text indexing, which have been
employed, are either based on index compression (by exploiting the redundancy between consecutive versions) [20,
21, 22], or based on index partitioning for faster temporal
selections [5, 6, 7, 10]. We will present recent works on
indexing, query processing and index maintenance efforts
towards supporting temporally qualified queries, i.e., [5, 6,
7, 10], in more detail.

2.4

Applications of Temporal IR

Some applications have taken time-based exploration of
textual archives beyond just searching over time, e.g., Time
Explorer [34], and time-aware exploration search [39]. Filtering and displaying information might benefit from presenting time information conveniently in some domains, for
instance, generating a timeline summary for a specific news
story [35, 52, 55] and for a given entity [50]. Arguably, the
most widespread summarization technology is the (query)
focused summaries produced by search engines, or search
results snippets using temporal expressions, which include
the most frequent units of time appearing in search result
pages [2, 15, 48]. There exists another form of temporal
summary in terms of landmark documents, authors, and
topics [47].
A series of temporal applications are the ones based on
prediction of events, e.g., [8, 23, 27]. The most challenging
task is the actual forecast of forthcoming events. A method
to turn a standard IR engine into a future event predicting
machine is proposed in [4], whereas an approach to forecasting real-life events by extracting information from a corpus
comprised of 22 years of news stories is presented in [42].

Temporal Query Analysis

Understanding search intent behind a user’s query is the
first step before applying a suitable retrieval and ranking
model. In the temporal search realm, a system should be
able to identify a query that contains an underlying temporal information need, so-called a temporal query [24]. We
categorize temporal queries into two main classes. The first
class of temporal queries can be observed through temporal patterns of user search behavior in query logs, whereas
the second class of temporal queries may not exhibit such
temporal patterns in a query stream, but can be referred to
specific time or a particular event.
In this tutorial, we will explain current approaches to understanding temporal query intent [32], as well as methods
for detecting and predicting time-sensitive queries, such as,
spiky, periodic or seasonal queries [43, 45]. In addition, we
will explain how to determine the underlying temporal information needs for a given temporal query by analyzing
temporal document collections [25, 29, 54].
We will address the problem of multi-faceted temporal
queries and its impact on result diversification [36, 46, 51,
56]. Finally, we will describe query enhancement techniques
applied to temporal queries, which include time-based pseudorelevance feedback [31, 40], and time-aware query reformulation [18, 26, 49].

Time-aware Ranking

– Conclusions and Future Directions (10 minutes)

Existing works on time-aware ranking can be classified
into different types based on two main notions of relevance
with respect to time: 1) recency-based ranking [16, 17, 19,
33], and 2) time-dependent ranking [11, 29]. Recency-based
ranking methods promote documents that are recently created or updated. The preference of freshness is quite common in a general web search, where a user looks for recent
information, e.g., about breaking news. On the other hand,
time-dependent ranking methods takes into account the relevant time periods underlying a given temporal query, which
this type of ranking explicitly adjusts the score of a document with respect to the time of queries, for example, by
assuming that documents with creation dates close to the
query’s time are more relevant and thus must be ranked
higher.
In addition to the aforementioned classification of timeaware methods, we also outline existing works that explicitly model entities and events into retrieval and ranking processes [9, 27, 44]. Note that, entity and event-based retrieval

INTENDED AUDIENCE AND MATERIAL

This tutorial targets graduate students, junior researchers
and practitioners in the field of information retrieval. Our
prospective participants should have a basic knowledge of
search processes, essentially regarding web crawling, document indexing, query analysis, and retrieval and ranking.
A prerequisite skill about other research areas, e.g., natural
language processing, is required but not mandatory. The
participants can download slides and a survey on temporal
information retrieval [28] from the authors’ homepages.
