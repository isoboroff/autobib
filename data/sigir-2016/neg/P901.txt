ABSTRACT
Many organizations possess social media accounts on different social networks, but these profiles are not always linked. End applications, users, as well as the organization themselves, can benefit when the profiles are appropriately identified and linked. Most
existing works on social network entity linking focus on linking
individuals, and do not model features specific for organizational
linking. We address this gap not only to link official social media
accounts but also to discover and solve the identification and linking of associated affiliate accounts – such as geographical divisions
and brands – which are important to distinguish.
We instantiate our method for classifying profiles on social network services for Twitter and Facebook, which major organizations
use. We classify profiles as to whether they belong to an organization or its affiliates. Our best classifier achieves an accuracy of
0.976 on average in both datasets, significantly improving baselines that exploit the features used in state-of-the-art comparable
user linkage strategies.

whole organization. An important task for both users and organizations is to automatically identify such profiles and link them to
get a holistic social media profile of an organization, but to the best
of our knowledge, up to now, this problem has been completely
ignored by the community.
Individual users do follow organizations through these profiles
to stay informed of their products, events and developments. However, they do not have ways to easily identify all such profiles that
belong to these organizations. Search engines of most SNSs currently do not distinguish between individual user profiles and organizational ones. While some Web search engines do provide links
to profiles in their search results, these links still rely on manual
effort by the organization (i.e., Google requires organizations to include specific markup in their Web page1 ; Figure 1). As such, one
may think that the organization itself should be responsible to link
their SNS account on their websites. Our experience shows that
this is not always the case, possibly due to challenges in organizational knowledge management or ignorance. Finally, to the best
of our knowledge, services that aggregate locations where we can
find such comprehensive links do not currently exist: we can identify only an organization’s main profile on the most popular SNS,
but not identify its affiliate profiles.
Organizations would benefit from automatic profile linkage to
help monitor their competitors’ profiles and activities – a fact that
has been proven by the existence of nascent start-ups2 . In addition, organizations also face the problem of tracking and policing
attempts by others to impersonate them or infringe upon their trademarks. For instance, Jetstar Airways fell victim to impersonation,
with a “Jetstar Australia” profile created on Facebook. This is used
to insult customers who mistakenly provided malicious feedback
through it3 .

INTRODUCTION

With the pervasiveness of social network services (SNSs), organizations also leverage them to reach out to and keep tabs on their
fans and potential customers. However, unlike individual users, organizations usually maintain multiple profiles, even within a single
SNS, to distribute targeted messages. This kind of intra-network
profiles often represent affiliates – entities such as brands or geographical divisions which are part of the organization but is not the

Affiliate. Profiles that represent one of the organization’s brands,
or a division. For example, Microsoft has several divisional
profiles such as @MicrosoftDesign, @MicrosoftAsia,
and so on.

Baseline Features (BL). These features examine the relationship between the target organization’s name (hereafter, “query”),
and the two name fields on a profile: the handle and the display
names. The handle name is sometimes known as a username, and
is a unique identifier that represents the profile on the social network. On the other hand, the display name is a free-text string
that provides a more user-friendly name, but is not unique. For example, on General Motors’ Twitter profile4 , the username is GM
while the display name is General Motors. We adopt the following
as baseline features:
• NED between the query and target handle name*
• NED between the query and target display name*

Unrelated. These profiles are not run by the organization in question, belonging to an individual or other organization. We
note that a profile unrelated to one organization may be an
official or affiliate profile for another.

Normalized edit distance (NED) gives a relative measure of similarity accounting for their lengths. Let ED(s1 , s2 ) be edit distance
between two strings s1 and s2 . Then, normalized edit distance
N ED(s1 , s2 ) between them is defined as follows:

To solve these problems, it is important to identify an organization’s social networking profiles on a specific network. We address
this task by defining three categories of profiles related to a given
organization:
Official. Profiles that represent the organization as a whole. For
instance, Microsoft Corporation’s official profile on Twitter
is @Microsoft.

The contributions in our work are: 1) An implemented, automated
system to perform organization profile linkage on social networks
– given an organization’s name as a query, it first searches for profile candidates from the target social networks, then constructs a
model by using supervised learning to classify each candidate into
Official, Affiliate, or Unrelated for the query; 2) The creation of a
publicly available dataset that consists of 6,784 profiles from about
220 real-world organizations across Twitter and Facebook, where
the profiles are manually classified into the above three categories.

where len(si ) denotes the length of string si (i = 1, 2).
In these features, we first process the query to generate a simple abbreviation and remove stop words (e.g., “Company,” “Corporation,” and so on) defined for this task before calculating the
edit distances between both the processed string and the original
query. These features best simulate how a human would approach
this problem.
Name-based Features (N). Name string lengths are also useful.
We term these as name-based features:
• Length of the query
• Length of the target display name*
• Length of the target handle name*
Description-based Features (D). These features are based on
the description field of the organization’s profile. Besides the relationship between the description and query, we further searched for
the organization’s description from DuckDuckGo5 , a search engine
that provides the results from sources such as Wikipedia.
• Cosine similarity between the target profile’s description and
the query
• Number of occurrences of the query in the target profile’s
description*
• Cosine similarity between the target profile’s description and
DuckDuckGo description*

RELATED WORK

The name fields of a profile have been shown to be of high importance in linking users. Two kinds of proposed linkage methods
rely on usernames: either through generating candidate usernames
to match with [7], or by examining behavioural patterns that influence the way usernames are created [8]. Another study found
that the user and display names are the “most discriminative features” [3] when disambiguating profiles.
Several works have examined user activities to identify a profile’s holder. These focused on using profile data and the content
created by the user [1], or combining the information with other
metadata (e.g., location or time [2]). Their findings are helpful for
our work as organizations often “cross-post” the same (or similar)
material across different social networks.
Works have addressed social network profiles in the context of
security – re-identification for anonymized social networks [4], spam
bot detection [6], malicious profile detection [5] – but these are beyond the scope of our current review due to space considerations.
The aforementioned studies have identified profiles on social networks, to the best of our knowledge, they have all focused on profiles belonging to individual users and do not consider the specific
properties of organization profiles, and are thus insufficient for linking organizations. For example, organizations often use an abbreviated form of their names online (e.g., General Motors uses just
“GM”), and their names often contain some common words such
as “Company” or “Corporation.” To accurately link organization
profiles, it is necessary to take these properties into account.

The first two features give measures of the extent to which the
profile’s description is relevant to the organization’s name. The
third yields a similarity score between the profile’s description and
organization descriptions provided by the DuckDuckGo general
search engine, which we deem as a more general, third-party description. Note that this feature requires an external API call.
Content-based Features (C). Posted content is also evidence
for linkage. We construct two bigram language models for each
category’s training data (Official, Affiliate, or Unrelated): one from
the profile descriptions in the target class, and the other from the
textual content of recent 20 posts by the target profiles. We use addone smoothing as a simple mechanism to address zero occurring
bigrams in the query. This process yields six models in total that
capture writing style differences:

FEATURES FOR CLASSIFIERS

• Probability that the query appears in bigram models constructed from official/affiliate/unrelated description*
• Probability that the query appears in bigram models constructed from official/affiliate/unrelated posted content*

We adopt supervised learning to classify organization names into
the three categories previously defined. We extract 14 features that
belong to the following four broad feature sets, annotating novel,
specific features we introduce for this organization linkage problem with an asterisk (*):

significance. This indicates that our ALL feature set is more effective than longest common subsequence-based distance in [1] and
length-based features in [8].
With respect to individual feature contributions, we further study
the improvement when adding N, D, or C feature set to the baseline
(Table 3). We observe higher improvement rate on affiliate profiles in both Twitter and Facebook datasets (N: 15.02%, D: 7.57%,
C:16.49% in TW-Aff and N: 7.61%, D: 4.54%, C:22.88% in FBAff). Among the feature sets, C is the most effective feature set
to distinguish official and affiliate profiles (9.56%, 16.49%, 7.49%,
22.88% in TW-Off, TW-Aff, FB-Off, and FB-Aff, respectively).
This indicates that content information extracted from profile description and recent posts do contain useful signal that can help
distinguish organizational names. Although acquiring such data
can be expensive, our experiments validates its significant impact
on the linkage accuracy.

EXPERIMENTS

We first construct the dataset for our experiments. We search for
organization names which are listed on Freebase6 as having at least
one social network presence, and then submit the each organization
name as a query to Twitter and Facebook. Finally, we manually label the profiles that Twitter and Facebook return. We obtain 3,381
profiles from 228 organizations and 3,403 profiles from 216 organizations on Twitter and Facebook, respectively (Table 1 shows
relevant statistics). Note that the number of organizations included
in each dataset differs from the number of official profiles that we
found, as some organizations either lack an official profile or have
more than one. To encourage the community to work on this important and understudied research work on social networks, we have
made our entire dataset publicly available7 .
To study linkage performance across classification methods, we
employ several different classifiers, namely: Bernoulli naïve Bayes
(BNB), Gaussian naïve Bayes (GNB), decision tree (DT), logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), support vector machine
(SVM), and maximum entropy (ME), all which are implemented in
scikit-learn8 . We perform 10-fold cross validation, evaluating each
classifier with their accuracy on the official and affiliate classes.
We compare the accuracies of classifiers constructed by combining “Baseline (BL),” “Name-based (N),” “Description-based (D),”
and “Content-based (C)” features described earlier (Table 2) . In
user identification works across SNSs, Iofciu et al. [1] reported
that longest common subsequence-based distance is an effective
feature in their “user maching based on username” experiments.
In a related vein, Zafarani and Liu [8] disclosed their top 10 most
important features, most of which are length-based ones. We also
compare our classifiers with those constructed using the features
from both [1] and [8].

Linking Affiliates. The existence of affiliate profiles is a distinguishing characteristic of our problem, differentiating it from
general linkage of individual profiles, or even linking official profiles alone. Both individuals and official profiles have names which
are generally close to that of their holder, and as such linkage of
affiliates would be expected to be more difficult. However, RF,
ME, and SVM classifiers all prove to be good and equally adept
at detecting both official and affiliate profiles, countering this intuition. Investigating this more fully reveals that this actually does
not hold with certain subclasses of affiliate profiles – while geographic affiliates do tend to contain their parent company’s name
with a location as a suffix as their profile name (e.g., “Microsoft
Asia”), brand names often have little in common (e.g., “Lenovo”
and “ThinkPad”). Hence, the use of the parent company name for
these brand profiles is insufficient to identify them as belonging to
the organization; additional information is required. These classifiers, with the equipped features from our study, still significantly
outperform the baseline and comparative methods.
Network Idiosyncrasies. On Twitter, all users are given the
same type of profiles regardless of whether they are a person or
an organization. On the other hand, Facebook has multiple profile types including Pages, which are designed for “artists, public
figures, businesses, brands, organizations, and non-profits9 .”
We considered only Pages here, effectively resulting in a level of
filtering provided by Facebook which Twitter does not have. Pages
with handle and display names similar to those of an organization
name are likely to belong to the organization.
However, this observation is not the case with affiliate profiles on
Facebook. Facebook does not require pages that specify a unique
handle name; in this scenario, we instead treat the page’s numerical ID as its handle name. This substitution greatly impacts on the
normalized edit distance scores in BL. It is sometimes the case that
an affiliate profile does not have a specific handle name – for instance, Netflix uses “Netflix” as its official profile’s handle name10 ,
but does not provide one for its Latin American affiliate11 .
In addition, Facebook also generates “topic pages” from Wikipedia
articles, giving them a display name from the title of that article but
no handle name. For example, a page exists for Samsung which has
just “Samsung” as its display name12 . We consider these pages to

DISCUSSION

In this section, we refer to “Twitter (Official),” “Twitter (Affiliate),” “Facebook (Official),” “Facebook (Affiliate)” as “TW-Off,”
“TW-Aff,” “FB-Off,” “FB-Aff,” respectively.
Classification Accuracies. In both Twitter and Facebook datasets,
DT, LR, RF, SVM, and ME achieve accuracies over 0.7 in almost
all feature sets (Table 2). Naïve Bayes in both forms (BNB and
GNB) yields lower accuracies (only about 0.2 to 0.7), especially in
the Affiliate category, even when adding more features.
Among the classifiers, Random Forest (RF) achieves the best in
both Twitter and Facebook datasets (0.983, 0.973, 0.972, 0.977 in
TW-Off, TW-Aff, FB-Off, FB-Aff, respectively). RF is an ensemble approach, taking an average of multiple decision trees’ decisions, which are separately trained on different parts of the same
training set, to reduce overfitting. While this step slightly increases
the bias of the forest, it decreases its variance. This framework of
RF works well for our task as each of our features tends to have
large variance.
With respect to features, we observe that using all features yields
the best accuracy in each classifier, and also outperforms the accuracies obtained by the features used in [1] and [8] with statistical

be unrelated. However, they have a similar edit distance as legitimate affiliate profiles. This makes it difficult to distinguish an affiliate profile on Facebook using just the handle and display names.
As we go forward, it is likely that other social networks will
exhibit their own unique set of quirks, which will similarly pose
challenges to linking profiles on them. We recommend that the
reader be mindful of these idiosyncrasies when adapting our work
for linkage with other SNSs.

CONCLUSION

We have proposed an approach to organizational social profile
linkage. To the best of our knowledge, this problem has not been
tackled before in the literature, but is a problem of growing importance given the amount of influence that social media plays in lives
today. A key difference in organization linkage is the presence of
affiliates – both geographic and brand – that change the nature of
the problem.
While previous efforts have done linkage through manual means,
our automated approach finds that profile description and posted
content are the most effective features for detecting linkage. In
future work, we plan to leverage unique characteristics of the different types of affiliate accounts to achieve better classification accuracy. This will allow us to infer affiliate structure (with respect
to the parent company), as well as to expand our work to include
other social networks.
