ABSTRACT

Table 1: Number of formal runs (number of teams)
in subtasks of Temporalia-1 and Temporalia-2.
Number of teams increased by 40% in Temporalia-2.

Research on temporal aspects of information retrieval has
recently gained considerable interest within the Information
Retrieval (IR) community. This paper describes our efforts
for building test collections for the purpose of fostering temporal IR research. In particular, we overview the test collections created at the two recent editions of Temporal Information Access (Temporalia) task organized at NTCIR-11
and NTCIR-12, report on selected results and discuss several
observations we made during the task design and implementation. Finally, we outline further directions for constructing
test collections suitable for temporal IR.

Time-related aspects can be actually bound to many components in the architecture of a search engine system and to
many steps of a retrieval process. For example, temporality may be already estimated on the level of input queries
(query issue time and temporal intent class). Documents
can be associated with different types of time (e.g., publication time, content focus time or content modification time)
allowing construction of temporally-aware search indexes.
Finally, retrieval mechanisms can output results according
to the match between the temporal aspects of query intents
and the estimated time scopes of documents [3].
While some prior attempts tried to survey the growing
field of Temporal IR [1, 7] or to investigate the actual user
needs and tactics while searching for information of temporal character [4], the community lacks common evaluation
grounds and standardized test beds for effective comparison
and evaluation of search technologies.
Temporal Information Access (Temporalia)1 tasks hosted
at NTCIR-11 [5] and NTCIR-12 [6] aimed to fill in this gap.
Both Temporalia-1 and Temporalia-2 consisted of two subtasks focusing on two crucial components necessary for designing an effective time-aware IR process. Temporal Query
Intent Categorization (TQIC ) in Temporalia-1 and Temporal Intent Disambiguation (TID) in Temporalia-2 dealt with
the problem of recognizing temporal class of search queries.
On the other hand, Temporal Information Retrieval (TIR)
and Temporally Diversified Retrieval (TDR) in Temporalia1 and Temporalia-2, respectively, concentrated on evaluating
document retrieval for information needs with underlying
temporal aspect. While English was our primary focus, the
second edition of Temporalia extended also the evaluation
to Chinese. Tab. 1 shows the overall participation in both
editions of the task, while Tab. 2 summarizes the resulting
test collections.

INTRODUCTION

Topical document relevance has traditionally been the key
concern in the development and evaluation of Information
Retrieval (IR) systems. Recently, however, IR community
has been interested in exploring other dimensions which underlie effective search processes such as the novelty, diversity,
coverage, and/or readability. Timeliness is one such quality
aspect of documents which, to a significant degree, determines user satisfaction, at least, for the subset of queries
whose underlying search intents contain strong temporal
component (e.g., Pisa weather, Olympics 2020). In
consequence, Temporal IR [1, 7] has started to emerge as one
challenge of information retrieval in which time and temporality play crucial roles.

RELATED TEST COLLECTIONS

Atemporal question
Search date

Although many tasks at TREC, CLEF or NTCIR have
been devoted to query analysis and document retrieval, only
a few of them particularly focused on temporal aspects in
search. Furthermore, temporal notions in other tasks were
typically limited to the timeliness and recency requirements
put on extracted information. TempSum and KBA are the
most relevant ones.
TREC’s Temporal Summarization task 2 (TempSum) is
composed of two subtasks: Sequential Update Summarization and Value Tracking. Sequential Update Summarization asks to find timely, sentence-level, reliable, relevant
and non-redundant updates about developing events, while
Value Tracking requires tracking values of event-related attributes (e.g., fatalities count) being of high importance to
the event. Both subtasks have clear temporal character since
the updates have to be not only relevant but also timely. Although, we also test ranking methods for the “recency” class
of search needs in our tasks, we do not limit the scope to
the information needs about recent or ongoing events, or to
a particular type of attribute-like information. Hence, any
temporal query category may become an input, and the results are output as lists of ranked documents rather than
information pieces.
One of its subtasks, Streaming Slot Filling, tracks the attributes and relations of a selected entity over time. Similarly to TempSum, the temporal information need is in the
form of a recency requirement. In addition, only documents
related to a particular entity such as a person or organization
are deemed relevant.

time distinction assuming the query issuing time as a center
(i.e., point “now”). In addition, we provided an atemporal
class for queries without any obvious time focus. The four
classes are defined below. We also show example queries
with their per-class probability distributions in Tab. 3.
Past: class of queries about past entities or events. Content relevant to past-related queries is not expected to change
significantly over time.
Recency: class of queries about present or recent entities or events. Relevant content for queries belonging to
the Recency class generally changes frequently and quickly
hence the search results are expected to contain timely and
up-to-date documents.
Future: class of queries about predicted, scheduled or
expected events. Search results should contain documents
with future-related information when compared to the query
issuing time.
Atemporal: class characterizing queries without any clear
temporal intent. Search results returned for atemporal queries
are not expected to be related to time, neither, their content should change much over time. Navigational queries
are considered to be atemporal.

3.1

Temporal Intent Detection

In both the task editions we have approached the problem of detecting temporal classes of intent underlying search
queries. According to the well-known study conducted in
2008 on the AOL query dataset [10], about 1.5% of queries
have been found to contain explicit temporal expressions
(e.g., Tokyo Olympics 1964, popular songs 2000s).
Although this rate may seem small at first, it amounts to
quite a large number of searches, and it does not cover
queries which lack clear temporal expressions which contain
strong implicit temporal component (e.g., Berlin Wall,
economic forecast or Tokyo Olympics).
Given the set of query strings associated with their submitting times, participants had to develop systems to de-

TEMPORAL INFORMATION ACCESS

First we discuss time categorization used in Temporalia.
Several categorizations of time are possible such as ones
according to calendar, frequency, periodicity, distance, etc.
However, the most common and the most natural distinction is the division of timeline into the past, present and future from the viewpoint of a speaker or information searcher.
Therefore, we have constructed our task around this natural

Estimated class

termine either the dominant temporal class (past, recency,
future and atemporal) of each of the queries (TQIC subtask
in Temporalia-1) or their per-class distribution (TID subtask
in Temporalia-2). Queries for both the dry and formal runs
were created based on seed set of temporal expressions and
were then collected from search engine query logs or search
suggestions given by major search engines. We have then
administered crowdsourcing tasks for determining the distribution of queries across the temporal classes. Each query
received 20 judgments.
The performance of submitted runs in TQIC was measured by the average rate of queries with correct temporal classes and, in TID, by (i) the averaged per-class absolute loss as well as (ii) by the cosine similarity between the
ground truth temporal class distribution and the distribution estimated by the participating systems.
In Fig.1 we show the system performance in Temporalia-1
TQIC subtask. Temporalia-2 TID results will be reported
at NTCiR-12 Conference, June 2016, Tokyo, Japan.

3.2.1

Document Collections

Both, Temporalia-1 and Temporalia-2 used the same document corpus for English called LivingKnowledge News and
Blogs Annotated Sub-collection constructed by the LivingKnowledge project and distributed by the Internet Memory
Foundation [9]. This collection of approximately 20GB size
spans the time period from May 2011 to March 2013 and
contains around 3.8M documents from about 1,500 different
blogs and news sources. We chose this collection since it has
a relatively long temporal span of documents. To facilitate
information extraction, we have indicated sentence boundaries as well as mentions of named entities, and we have also
disambiguated detected temporal expressions.
Temporalia-2 has also introduced Chinese language. SogouCA 3 and SogouT 4 document collections were used for
the dry run and formal run, respectively. Three kinds of annotations were provided: sentence splitting, named entities,
and time annotations.

Temporal Ranking

The second problem relates to ranking results for queries
containing temporal requirement. First, Temporal Information Retrieval (TIR) at Temporalia-1 asked participants to
retrieve a set of documents for a search topic that incorporates time factor. In addition to a standard search topic
data (i.e., title, description, and sub topics), TIR search
topic contained the query submitting date information to
indicate the relationship between the query and searcher.
Temporally Diversified Retrieval (TDR) extended TIR by
requiring participants to separately retrieve ranked lists of
documents relevant to each of four temporal intent classes
for a given topic. Participants were also asked to return a
set of documents that is temporally diversified for the same
topic. TDR participants received a set of topic descriptions,
query issuing time, and indicative search questions for each
of temporal classes (Past, Recency, Future, and Atemporal). The objective of the indicative search questions was to
demonstrate one possible subtopic under a particular temporal class. In Tab. 4 we show an example topic with its
subtopics.
For the evaluation, the standard Cranfield methodology
was used. In particular, a pool of potentially relevant documents was created based on the top-ranked documents from
participants’ submitted runs. Then each document in the
pool was assessed through online crowdsourcing (3 judgments per document for each class), and its relevance grade
was judged. Given a ranked list generated for a specific
temporal subtopic, the system performance was evaluated
using Precision, Q-measure and nDCG metric. For a diversified ranked list generated to satisfy all possible temporal

DISCUSSIONS

In this section we discuss several observations obtained
during the task design and we outline some future directions:
Challenges with Recency and Future classes: Recency and Future classes seem to be the most challenging
when it comes to recognizing temporal intent. The mean
classification accuracy for these classes were 0.565 and 0.678,
respectively, compared to 0.687 and 0.733 for the Atemporal
and Past classes, respectively. This can be also seen in Fig.

We think that the combination of the document creation
and focus time coupled with the estimated query’s temporality and its issuing date should offer sufficient for judging
temporal correspondence of documents to the query. Finally, future challenges could be designed to testing temporal query suggestion or retrieval mechanisms over long term
document archives.

CONCLUSIONS

In this paper we have reported the results of our recent efforts towards building test collections for fostering Temporal
IR and related applications in the context of Temporalia-1
and Temporalia-2 tasks at NTCIR-11/12. Both tasks focused on two important objectives. The first one is to test
methods for recognizing temporal aspects behind query intent. The second objective is to facilitate comparison of
document ranking methods according to temporal classes of
queries. Unlike other test collections, Temporalia’s test collections are designed to let researchers compare performance
of their systems across major temporal classes.

Figure 4: Overview of techniques used in TQIC.
constructing a query set that would be appropriately balanced over query classes. For example, Atemporal class was
ubiquitous for each query making it difficult to find many
queries without substantial probability score in the Atemporal class. Relatedly, the combinations in which relatively
high rate was observed in the Future as well as in the Past
class were quite rare. All these issues made the construction
of symmetrical test set collections a difficult challenge.
Sources of temporal signals: Participants used variety
of external sources and tools for capturing temporal signals.
For a rough overview, we show in Fig. 4 the types of temporal signals and techniques used by the participating teams
in the TQIC subtask.
Relation to search result diversification tasks: IMine
[8] and Intent [12] tasks focus on various aspects of search result diversification in IR. For example, Query Understanding
(QU ) and Vertical Incorporating (VI ) subtasks in IMine-2
require to identify the subtopics of a query or diversify organic results respectively. Temporal intent detection and
temporal diversification of results could be then regarded as
attempts at enforcing higher level diversification, i.e., diversification not on the level of subtopics but, on the level of
temporal classes, each of which typically covers several possible subtopics that share the same temporal orientation.
Task participation: As indicated in Tab. 1, the number of participating teams in Temporalia-2 increased by 40%
from Temporalia-1. This demonstrates the need for and
benefits of Temporalia’s test collections. As for the subtask breakdown, tasks related to estimating temporal query
classes were more popular than ones for retrieving documents. Besides the presumed difficulty of indexing the document collection, the need to cope with large data sizes as
well as with the content of varying subtopics, the other reasons for this preference could come from the problems with
estimating temporality of large text chunks in contrast to
short query strings that can be rather easily manipulated.
We also note that Chinese language TDR failed to attract
any participation in contrast to Chinese language TID. This
may suggest that the additional difficulty of processing large
amounts of ideograms in documents might have outweighed
the benefits of solving the task in a language less commonly
researched within the IR community.
Future of Temporal IR evaluation: Estimating focus time of documents [1, 3], which is the time to which
documents refer to, could be one possible subtask in the future. Another challenge is estimating document creation
time. In this context, we note that SemEval2015 introduced Diachronic Text Evaluation task [11] which required
to identify time interval when a given piece of news text
