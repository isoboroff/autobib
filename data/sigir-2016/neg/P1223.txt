ABSTRACT

teractions among the three main components: crawler, indexer, and query processor.

Commercial web search engines need to process thousands of
queries every second and provide responses to user queries
within a few hundred milliseconds. As a consequence of
these tight performance constraints, search engines construct and maintain very large computing infrastructures
for crawling the Web, indexing discovered pages, and processing user queries. The scalability and efficiency of these
infrastructures require careful performance optimizations in
every major component of the search engine.
This tutorial aims to provide a fairly comprehensive
overview of the scalability and efficiency challenges in largescale web search engines. In particular, the tutorial provides
an in-depth architectural overview of a web search engine,
mainly focusing on the web crawling, indexing, and query
processing components. The scalability and efficiency issues
encountered in these components are presented at four different granularities: at the level of a single computer, a cluster
of computers, a single data center, and a multi-center search
engine. The tutorial also points out some open research
problems and provides recommendations to researchers who
are new to the field.

The web crawler is responsible for discovering new web
pages and downloading their content while refreshing the
content of previously downloaded pages [42]. The main performance objective for a web crawler is to achieve high page
download rates. The efficiency of a sequential crawler is
mainly determined by the selection and implementation of
proper data structures [36]. Scalability is achieved through
multi-threading [30] and parallelization [23]. In addition to
such techniques, our tutorial covers the URL reordering [46]
and web repository refreshing [43] problems.

OUTLINE

The tutorial has four sections. The first section provides
the main concepts. Each of the remaining sections covers a
particular architectural component of a web search engine.

1.1

Indexing

The indexing process involves various parsing, extraction,
and classification tasks, through which certain features are
extracted and the textual content of downloaded pages are
converted into an inverted index [51]. The main performance metrics for an indexer are the length of deployment
cycles, compactness, and the speed of index updates. So
far, most algorithmic improvements are concentrated on index compression [44], duplicate detection [29], and document reordering [12, 47]. At the architectural level, the efficiency and scalability are improved via online index construction [38], index partitioning [20], and static index pruning [2, 41]. Our tutorial also covers the indexing strategies
for geographically distributed web search engines [33].

Query Processing

Query processing involves generating the set of bestmatching results for a given user query [9]. The success of
a query processor is mainly assessed by its throughput and
average response latency. A large body of research work
on relevance ranking assume relatively standard processing
techniques using an inverted index while large-scale search
engines rely on more sophisticated techniques. In addition
to the state-of-the-art ranking techniques employed in web
search engines, our tutorial covers a variety of problems including query processing on multi-core architectures [48],
pipelined query processing [31], response latency prediction [40], selective search [35], query forwarding [21, 49],
query scheduling [26], power/energy cost efficiency [27, 34],
multi-site web search [7, 25], and green search engines [13].
We also briefly present learning-to-rank optimizations in web
search [22, 39, 50] and discuss the impact of efficiency improvements on user engagement [3, 4, 11].

Main Concepts

In this section, we provide the necessary background for
the following sections. First, we explain the main challenges
posed by the Web and its characteristics. Second, we present
the main components of a search engine and possible software/hardware architectures. Finally, we summarize the inPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or

This section also covers caching in web search engines [6,
24]. The idea behind caching is to speed up query response
times by storing precomputed query results, also reducing the computational workload of backend search systems.
Caching happens at different architectural layers in a web
search engine [45]. The tutorial covers common challenges in
caching, such as admission [8], eviction [28], and prefetching [37]. It also focuses on the freshness problem, which
attracted much research attention [1, 10, 12, 19, 32].

and Ph.D. degrees, all in computer engineering, from the
Computer Engineering Department of Bilkent University in
1997, 2000, and 2006, respectively. After getting his Ph.D.
degree, he worked as a postdoctoral researcher in Bilkent
University for a short period of time. In 2006, he joined
the Biomedical Informatics Department of the Ohio State
University as a postdoctoral researcher. In 2008, he joined
Yahoo Labs as a postdoctoral researcher. He received
research scientist and senior research scientist positions
at the same institution, in 2010 and 2012, respectively.
Between 2013 and 2015, he was a senior manager, heading
the web retrieval group in Yahoo Labs Barcelona. His main
research interests are distributed information retrieval and
web search efficiency. In 2010, 2011, 2014, and 2015, he coorganized the LSDS-IR workshop. He was the proceedings
chair for WSDM’09 and the poster and proceedings chairs
for ECIR’12. He served as an area chair in SIGIR’13 and
SIGIR’14. He regularly serves on the program committees
of SIGIR, WWW, and KDD conferences. He is a member
of the editorial board of IP&M. He has many papers
published in prestigious journals including IEEE TPDS,
JPDC, JASIST, Inf. Syst., ACM TWEB, and IP&M,
as well as papers and tutorials presented at top-tier conferences, such as SIGIR, CIKM, WSDM, WWW, and KDD.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
The following are the main objectives of the tutorial.
• To provide an in-depth background on the architectural components of a web search engine.
• To present the fundamental scalability and efficiency
issues which have been often addressed in the information retrieval literature.
• To shed some light into the techniques used in largescale commercial search engines and bridge the gap
between the industry and academia.
• To identify open research problems in the context of
web search engine scalability and efficiency, promoting
further research on the topic.

PREVIOUS EDITIONS

The initial structure of this tutorial series is based on
a book chapter published by the presenters [14]. Earlier
versions of the tutorial were presented in SIGIR’13 [15],
WWW’14 [5], SIGIR’14 [16], WSDM’15 [17], and CIKM’15.
The tutorial was also given in three different summer
schools: the 2nd COST 804 Training School on Energy Efficiency in Large Scale Distributed Systems, the 3rd MUMIA
Training School on Information Retrieval and Interactive Information Access, and more recently, the 10th European
Summer School in Information Retrieval. The presenters
have also published a short book whose structure and content is based on these tutorials [18].

TARGET AUDIENCE

Efficiency has been one of the main research topics in the
previous editions of the SIGIR conference. The topics covered in this tutorial have a fairly high overlap with those
encountered in the efficiency-related paper sessions in SIGIR. As a supporting fact, the presenters of the tutorial
co-authored a large number of papers in recent years’ efficiency sessions. A subset of the topics covered in the tutorial
are taken from the papers presented in the efficiency sessions
of related conferences, such as WSDM and WWW.
Since the tutorial was already presented in SIGIR before,
this edition of the tutorial aims to come with a major content update. Unlike the previous editions, which all targeted
intermediate audiences, this edition targets an advanced audience. Therefore, the introductory sections of the tutorial
are compressed, making space for relatively new and more
technical material. We aim to go into more depth in selected topics in the context of web search efficiency, such as
machine-learned ranking systems, user impact of efficiency
optimizations, and energy-efficient and green web search
engines. Although the attendees are expected to have a
solid understanding of fundamental concepts related to web
search, parts of the presented material should be easy to
follow by beginner and intermediate audiences as well.
