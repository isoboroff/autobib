ABSTRACT

rated into the design of recent test collections (e.g., Contextual Suggestion Track at TREC [2]), the scope of individual
information represented by “user profiles” is far too limited
to evaluate lifelog systems.
The contribution of this paper is a description of the requirements for a lifelog test collection (Section 2) and a description of the first lifelog test collection (Section 3) that
has been employed in the Lifelog Task1 of the NTCIR-12
Evaluation Forum. This is followed (Section 4) by a short
list of potential applications of the test collection.

Test collections have a long history of supporting repeatable
and comparable evaluation in Information Retrieval (IR).
However, thus far, no shared test collection exists for IR
systems that are designed to index and retrieve multimodal
lifelog data. In this paper we introduce the first test collection for personal lifelog data, which has been employed for
the NTCIR12-Lifelog task. In this paper, the requirements
for the test collection are motivated, the process of creating
the test collection is described, along with an overview of
the test collection. Finally suggestions are given for possible
applications of the test collection.

CREATING THE TEST COLLECTION

The basic structure of test collections used for IR research
is based on the standard three components of 1) a collection of domain-representative documents, 2) a set of queries
(called topics) that are representative of the domain of application, and 3) a set of relevance judgements. This section describes requirements that are particularly relevant to
lifelog test collections. Moreover, we share our experiences
of generating a test collection of personal lifelog data.

INTRODUCTION

One aspect of IR that has been gathering increasing attention in recent years is the concept of lifelogging. Lifelogging
is defined as a form of pervasive computing, consisting of a
unified digital record of the totality of an individual’s experiences, captured multi-modally through digital sensors and
stored permanently as a personal multimedia archive [3].
Lifelogging typically generates multimedia archives of lifeexperience data in an enormous (potentially multi-decade)
lifelog. Therefore a lifelog needs to be organised and searchable to be of value to the individual / lifelogger, hence there
have been calls for a test collection of lifelog data [6].
However, the design and construction of a lifelog test collection is not trivial. Jones and Teeven [9], in the context
of personal information management (PIM), state that “the
design of shared test collections for PIM evaluation requires
some creative thinking, because such collections must differ
from more traditional shared test collections”. Although an
increased level of individual information has been incorpo-

2.1

Requirements for the Test Collection

Prior to generating the test collection we defined requirements for the collection based on our experiences of developing prototype lifelogging applications and relevant literature
concerning lifelogging and human memory, such as [11].

Validity of the Collection.
In order to allow for statistically significant studies in the
field of lifelogging, a test collection needs to contain (a sample of) a dataset that is large enough to represent real-world
data of lifeloggers. Since many lifeloggers use visual data
to record daily activities and reflect upon their behaviour
(e.g., [1]), we needed visual lifelogs captured from wearable
cameras along with metadata describing the daily life of the
lifelogger, such as locations and physical activities. Similarly, realistic topics are required representing real-world information needs, based on the experience of individuals who
engage in lifelogging.

Privacy by Design.
In the field of lifelogging, personal sensor data (especially
camera or audio data) will carry privacy concerns [10, 4].

Temporal Alignment.

Therefore, we must consider the principles of privacy-bydesign when creating the test collection. This means removing user-identifiable data from the collection, yet maintaining the usefulness of the data for the proposed purpose of
supporting experimental IR research.

It was important to ensure temporal alignment of the sensor data, given that it is from two distinct devices. It was
necessary to check and resolve alignment problems (typically in the order of 1-2 minutes) for one lifelogger by crossreferencing reported timestamps from the Autographer camera with clocks captured daily in the real-world.

Facilitation of Research Activities.
In order to encourage comparative evaluation over lifelog
data, the dataset needs to include sufficient metadata so as
to lower the overhead for participation, hence allowing researchers interested in a broad range of IR-related applications to utilise the test collection. Moreover, a reusable test
collection is required that can support a number of years of
ongoing research activities. Addressing these issues, a lifelog
dataset requires a set of relevance judgements that can be
utilised both as a source of data for comparative evaluation
as well as being later utilised as a source of training data for
future lifelog system experimentation.

Data Filtering for Privacy Preservation.
Given the personal nature of lifelog data, it was necessary
to give the lifeloggers an opportunity to remove any data
that they may be uncomfortable sharing. This involved a
manual inspection of all their lifelog data before sharing it
with us. Following this, all images were reviewed by one
trusted individual with oversight of the entire collection to
ensure that no potentially embarrassing or offensive images
were accidentally included in the collection.

Anonymisation of the Dataset.

2.2

Two steps were taken to ensure privacy of both the lifeloggers and individuals (subjects and bystanders) captured
in the lifelog, by removing identifiable content. Firstly, each
recognisable face in every image was blurred in a manual
process, which ensured no false positives or missed faces. A
second step was to resize every image down to 1024 x 768
resolution which had the effect of both reducing the disksize of the collection, but also rendering the majority of any
on-screen text captured by the lifelogging camera to be illegible. Since privacy extends beyond content of images, the
Moves app automatically converts all locations from absolute GPS locations into semantic locations, which resulted
in potentially sensitive absolute addresses being labeled with
generic names such as ’home’ or ’work’, thereby making it
more unlikely that the lifeloggers could be identified.

Process of Creating the Test Collection

Given the requirements for the lifelog test collection to be
as realistic as possible, there were a number of steps that
were taken to ensure that this was the case, while at the
same time respecting the concept of privacy-by-design and
the personal nature of the rich media data being donated by
a number of lifeloggers.

Low-overhead Multimodal Data Capture.
Due to the long-term, always-on, nature of lifelog data
gathering, it was important to reduce the overhead on the
lifelogger of gathering the data. Hence, the data was gathered using only two logging devices, the OMG Autograper
wearable camera and a smartphone running the Moves app2 .
The OMG Autographer is worn on a lanyard around the
neck, is orientated towards the activity the wearer is engaged in and can operate for a full-day on a battery charge.
This camera takes photos passively (i.e., without explicit
user intervention) and as such, it gathers a detailed digital
trace of the activities of the wearer at about two images
per minute. This camera is a later generation of the Microsoft Sensecam wearable camera [7]. The Moves app is
a smartphone app that automatically records user activity
in terms of semantic locations and physical activities (e.g.
waking, cycling, running, transport), without requiring any
user intervention. This app was installed on the personal
smartphones used by the lifeloggers. The moves data was
exported from the Moves cloud-service after the data gathering process was complete.

DETAILS OF THE TEST COLLECTION

TITLE: Tower Bridge
DESCRIPTION: Find the moment(s) when I was looking at Tower Bridge in London.
NARRATIVE: To be considered relevant, the full span
of Tower Bridge must be visible. Moments of crossing the Tower Bridge or showing some subset of Tower
Bridge are not considered relevant.

The Dataset

The NTCIR Lifelog test collection consists of data from
three lifeloggers for a period of about one month each. The
lifeloggers would all have had involvement with a university,
but in different roles. The lifeloggers gathered data in an
all-day gathering process; thereby gathering a wide range
of daily activities. The data volume was roughly equally
distributed per lifelogger. The data consists of a collection
of wearable camera images (taken by an OMG Autographer
camera) as shown in Figure 1; in total there were 88,124
images in the test collection. It also contains 130 semantic locations (e.g., Starbucks cafe, Dublin Airport, home,
work) which were the places where the lifeloggers went (and
lingered for some time) during their month of data gathering. Additionally, the physical activities (e.g., walking,
transport, cycling) of the lifelogger during this month were
included on a minute-by-minute basis. All data is accompanied by XML markup at the minute level of granularity. An
example of the XML description is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 3: LSAT Topic Example
The 48 search topics, called LSAT (Lifelog Semantic Access) Topics, were suggested by the three lifeloggers and
they represent the challenge of Retrieval from memories.
These topics were evaluated in terms of traditional IR effectiveness measurements such as Precision, Recall, MAP and
NDCG. An example of an LSAT topic is shown in Figure
3. Table 2 shows ten example LSAT topics, the number of
relevant results for each topic, and the recall performance of
the best official automatic and interactive runs. For further
details, the reader is referred to the more detailed Lifelog
task overview paper from the NTCIR-12 proceedings [5].

Lifelog collection, showing the number of relevant
events, the recall performance of the best performing automatic and interactive runs.
Additionally, there are ten exploratory topics representing the challenge of supporting Reflection from memories.
These are called LIT (Lifelog Insight) Topics and are not
evaluated in a traditional sense, rather, participants were
encouraged to prepare insights (in any form) and demonstrate them directly to other participants at the NTCIR-12
Conference. An example of an LIT topic is shown in Figure 4.

for one minute
Given the fact that lifelog data is typically visual in nature, and to lower the barriers to participation for noncomputer vision researchers, the output of the CAFFE visual concept detector [8] was included in the test collection
as a source of additional visual metadata. This software
provided labels and probabilities of occurrence for 1,000 everyday objects in every image (objects such as school bus,
pizza, radio, ostrich, bridegroom, desktop computer, etc.).
A summary of the test collection is shown in Table 1.

TITLE: Early Morning Commute
DESCRIPTION: Early Provide insights on the methods
of, and duration, each lifelogger spends commuting to
work.
NARRATIVE: Commuting to work or university, via
whatever means, is relevant. Commuting to a meeting
in a location that is not the user’s normal place of work
is also relevant if it could be considered to be a morning
commute to work. Commuting home is not relevant.
General travelling is not relevant.

The Topics

Aside from the data, the test collection includes a set of
topic descriptions that are representative of the real-world
information needs of lifeloggers and represent the Retrieval
and Reflection reasons for accessing memories [11]. Some
topics have a single correct result, whereas others require
a number of relevant events to be returned for every topic.

The Relevance Assessments

5.

The pooling method of creating relevance judgements is
the typical approach for large-datasets in IR. Specifically
with regard to the LSAT task, however, the relevance judgements were manual (non-pooled), and were generated by
the lifeloggers and reviewed by the task organisers. The
data was segmented into topic-specific events manually and
at evaluation time, submissions in the form of image IDs
(smallest unit of retrieval) were mapped onto events and
the events judged as relevant or not relevant. If there were
more than one image from any given event identified as relevant, then only the top ranked image (from that event) was
selected for evaluation.
In addition, so as to make the test collection as useful as
possible for a wide-range of researchers, we also provided
relevance judgements for the LSAT task on a per-image basis, as the smallest unit of retrieval possible from this test
collection.
Since the LIT task was an exploration-focused task, rather
than a retrieval-focused task, there were no relevance judgements prepared for the LIT task. Instead, the LIT task participants presented their findings, techniques and insights in
oral and poster session at NTCIR-12.

This paper reported the design and construction of the
first test collection for lifelog research. A document collection and information needs of the NTCIR Lifelog test collection are highly individual and multimodal when compared
to conventional test collections.
Research conducted by participants of NTCIR-12 Lifelog
Task was presented at the NTCIR-12 Conference, June 710, 2016 at Tokyo, Japan, and at a parallel workshop at the
University of Glasgow. Based on our experiences and feedback from participants, we will prepare a new test collection
for NTCIR-13, which will incorporate additional sources of
contextual data (e.g., audio, computer interactions, physical accelerations/movement, biometrics) and the provision
of more raw-metadata, as opposed to the semantic data that
was provided with this collection.

POTENTIAL RESEARCH CHALLENGES

Having a large collection of annotated personal data, such
as this lifelog test collection, opens up a number of research
opportunities:
• Multi-modal search and retrieval over archives of personal data.
• Lifelog-specific access, addressing many applications of
memory, as defined by [11].
• Activity recognition from real-world data, in terms of
both physical and real-world activities.
• Visual concept extraction, from real-world all-day wearable camera data (with additional supporting metadata).
• Time-series analysis of all-day personal data over extended time-periods from one, or multiple users.
• Generating insights & analytics from real-world datasets
of wearable personal sensing.
• Contextual analysis of real-world user activities, to
support exploratory approaches to contextual information access.
• Privacy-aware retrieval, to explore the privacy concerns surrounding search and retrieval from large lifelog
archives.
The NTCIR-12 Lifelog test collection can be used to facilitate such research challenges of lifelog data. Both the
document collection and query data will be released to research communities after the NTCIR-12 conference and will
be made available to researchers who sign up to a (standard)
data-release agreement.
