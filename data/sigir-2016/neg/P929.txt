ABSTRACT

Web archives can provide access to historical information
that is absent on the current Web, like previous companies,
products, events, entities etc. However, even after a long
time of existence, Web archives are still lacking search capabilities that make them truly accessible and usable as temporal resources. Available access methods include lookup
services, such as the Wayback Machine 2 , or indexing methods for efficient temporal queries [1, 2], but retrieval models
to rank versions of webpages are limited to relevance cues
from document content [3]. This is primarily due to the
inability of the models to determine which page was important at a given instant or interval of time. Furthermore,
as there are often multiple versions of a page, it is difficult
to identify which version among them is the most relevant
and different versions of the same page may be relevant at
different points in time. To make matters worse, it is even
more difficult to identify the variations of a page that are
the most interesting for users in a given time period only by
analyzing internal properties of a page, like its content, as
detailed in [5].
While determining authority of pages in an archive independent of a query has been attempted [8], popularity cues
from external sources have not been considered. By incorporating external data, such as explicit temporal information
about a website’s popularity, this can be simplified and lead
to a better retrieval performance. Sources for this can be
any websites reporting about other websites, such as social
networks, where users post their favorite or most controversial websites at a specific time of interest. Besides the
explicit time information, another advantage of searching
external data instead of websites itself is the more focused
descriptions of only relevant pages. Users typically post the
essence instead of the often verbose contents found on the
websites, including layouts, comments, etc. Finally, this also
allows for a much more clean and compact index, a critical
factor for ever growing Web archive collections with sizes of
hundreds of terabytes.
One of those resources is the social bookmarking service
Delicious3 , where users post popular links and describe them
with a concise set of tags as succinct descriptors. These
tags carry temporal information that can be exploited for
search: While the tag commuity is frequently assigned to
facebook.com today, other communities, such as myspace.com
were tagged with the term before. The idea to base search on
tags has been previously explored, but never in a temporal
dimension [4, 6].

Web archives are large longitudinal collections that store
webpages from the past, which might be missing on the current live Web. Consequently, temporal search over such collections is essential for finding prominent missing webpages
and tasks like historical analysis. However, this has been
challenging due to the lack of popularity information and
proper ground truth to evaluate temporal retrieval models.
In this paper we investigate the applicability of external longitudinal resources to identify important and popular websites in the past and analyze the social bookmarking service
Delicious for this purpose.
The timestamped bookmarks on Delicious provide explicit
cues about popular time periods in the past along with relevant descriptors. These are valuable to identify important
documents in the past for a given temporal query. Focusing
purely on recall, we analyzed more than 12,000 queries and
find that using Delicious yields average recall values from
46% up to 100%, when limiting ourselves to the best represented queries in the considered dataset. This constitutes an
attractive and low-overhead approach for quick access into
Web archives by not dealing with the actual contents.

INTRODUCTION

Most of the information and published content is either
online or has been moving to the Web. Consequently, there
has been a surge of collection, curation and preservation efforts to archive the live and ephemeral Web. While some institutions, such as the Internet Archive1 , attempt to archive
the Web comprehensively, more and more national organizations and libraries target the Web under their own top-level
domains. The growing number of such endeavors all around
the world make Web archives a valuable resource for social
scientists, historians, computer scientists as well as for the
average user.

truth we compare against query logs from MSN and AOL
from the same time. These contain two and four URLs that
users clicked on for the query american apparel: americanapparel.net and americanapparelstore.com on MSN
as well as allonlinecoupons.com and usawear.org additionally on AOL. As only the first two are contained in the
set of URLs from Delicious, it reaches a full recall of 100%
(1.0) with respect to MSN and 50% (0.5) w.r.t. AOL. Analyzing the precision remains for future work as it will require
an appropriate retrieval model to rank the relevant links up
to the top. A high recall, however, is a crucial prerequisite
to make the system usable in practice.

2.1

With Tempas (Temporal archive search) we have created
a prototype to search webpages based on a Delicious dataset
over nine years4 . Tempas links directly into a Web archive
to show the versions described by the users in their posts
[7]. We exploit the frequencies of posts as well as mutual
information of tags attached to a page as indicator of their
relevance to a certain topic. Tempas is a fully functional
system to search Web archives in a temporal manner on
a relatively small and concise index. However, before we
can continue to tune this system to a high precision it is
essential to understand what is available in the used dataset
and which of the websites that really mattered to users of
search engines in the past can be found with it. It is crucial
to keep in mind the inherent bias of the dataset used for this
task.
In this paper we analyze the applicability of Delicious for
searching documents published in the past based on the following research questions:
(R1) What fraction of websites clicked by users on a search
engine in the past are included in Delicious as well?
(R2) What topics or entities are covered by Delicious?
(R3) What are the natural limitations of Delicious as a
dataset for temporal Web archive search?
(R4) How do posting times on Delicious and query times in
search engines relate to each other?

ANALYSIS

The Delicious dataset spans nine years from 2003 to 2011
and contains about 340 mio. bookmarks, 119 mio. unique
URLs, 15 mio. tags and 2 mio. users [9]. Each bookmarked
URL is time stamped and tagged with descriptors. The
methodology of our analysis is shown in Figure 1.
We begin with a query workload and identify the associated tags for each query in Delicious. This is done by using
Bing search results as a proxy and selecting tags attached to
the returned URLs. We then compute the overlap of clicked
search results in two query logs, from AOL and MSN, and
the URLs tagged with the query or its expanded tags to
compute the recall of Delicious for temporal search. This is
done for overlapping time intervals of both datasets, query
logs and Delicious, which are May 2006 for MSN and March
to May 2006 for AOL.
As an example scenario consider the clothing brand American Apparel. Using the approach as described below, we
map this query to the tags americanapparel and apparel
as well as t-shirts, which appears to be used quite synonymously on Delicious. In the next step, we retrieve all URLs
that were tagged with any of these tags during a given time,
here May 2006. This results in 227 URLs. As a ground

Query-Tag Mapping

Our query workload comprises article titles from the German Wikipedia, which we consider as entities in the following. In principle, the approach is applicable to any type
of queries, but the mapping of entity names to tags is more
straightforward than arbitrary multi-keyword queries, which
would usually refer to a set of tags instead of single representatives. The used Wikipedia collection consists of 1.8
million articles from the main namespace without disambiguation and list pages. The focus on German aligns with
the Web archive available to us and also narrows down the
vast number of articles on Wikipedia. The titles were issued
as queries to Bing between August 7 and 13, 2015 and we
stored the top 100 results for each query.
To map the queries to tags that best represent the corresponding entity, we collected all tags from Delicious that
were attached to the retrieved URLs from Bing and used
by at least 10 users. From these we kept only those tags
that were used by at least 10% of the users who posted
one of the URLs for that query. In addition, we selected
a reference tag wref tag that exactly matches the query
after down-casing and removing special characters. E.g.,
wref (Barack Obama) = barackobama. For the remaining
tags we computed an adaption of IDF (inverse document
frequency) based on the total number of considered queries
and relative to the reference tag for normalization:
idf(w) =

log(|queries|)
|{q ∈ queries | w ∈ tags(q)}|

rel.idf(w) =

idf(w)
idf(wref )

This number indicates the generality of the tag, i.e., how specific it is to the assigned query. Additionally, we computed
what we call exclusiveness. A high exclusiveness indicates
that the tag does not often co-occur with the reference tag,
which would be uncommon if both tags represent the same
entity:
excl(w) = 1 −

#posts(w, wref )
min(#posts(w), #posts(wref ))

#posts(w1 , w2 , ...) defines the number of posts on Delicious
with all specified tags w1 , w2 , ... as unique pairs of user and
posted URL to filter spammers with a large number of posts
of the same URL.
To combine the numbers we computed the average score of
each tag w as 0.5 · (rel.idf(w) + excl(w)) for every query with
reference tag wref . The resulting score indicates how specific a tag is to its considered query and at the same time
how complementary or exchangeable it is to the reference

popular entities (R3).
To ensure the observed recalls are not due to a poor mapping (s. Sec. 2.1), we computed the recall values of the
same entities also by considering the entire Delicious dataset,
not only results retrieved by the mapped tags (unmapped ).
This suggests the upper bound, which could potentially be
reached given a better entity-tag mapping. However, as
presented in the figure, these recall values are only slightly
higher than the ones achieved with our mapping.
Overall, the average recall values of the entire experiment
resulted in 48% w.r.t. MSN and 46% w.r.t. AOL. Although
this is already a good result, it gets even better by looking
at those entities, which are strongly represented on Delicious
and reached the highest recalls in the experiment. As presented in Figure 3, for the top 2000 entities we achieve a full
recall w.r.t. both query logs. The top 6000, which is about
50%, still exhibit a recall of almost 0.8 with even slightly
higher values w.r.t. AOL (R1).
This shows, about half of the URLs that users clicked in a
search engine can be found by using Delicious as an external
data source to search Web archives. Even more intriguing,
if used with the queries that are best represented by the
dataset, we can even reach much higher values up to a recall
of 100%.

tag, which we consider a representation of the corresponding entity. Experiments have shown that a threshold of 0.7
reliably identifies true representative tags for a query. Thus,
we took all tags with a score equal or greater as well as wref .
Examples are shown in Table 1. Although this simple
approach is not accurate in all cases, it is good enough for
an experiment like ours. While it worked well for entities
like Wikipedia, it sometimes yields too general tags, like
popular in case of Craigslist. For other entities, some
tags seem too generic at the first glance, but appear to be
used almost synonymously on Delicious, such as the format
flv for YouTube. However, the quality is acceptable and
a better mapping would have only resulted in even higher
recall values as we will show in the following.

Tags

Querying

To assess the recall of the considered Delicious dataset,
we queried it for the identified tags and at the same time
selected records for the corresponding entity from the MSN
and AOL query logs. We matched queries with exact name
as extracted from the Wikipedia titles, ignoring case. The
clicked URLs for a given query served as ground truth in
the experiment and we measured recall by counting how
many of those could be also found in Delicious. Each URL
annotated with one of the considered tags was selected. We
operated under the assumption that tags identified by us
were also used back in the past, which we believe is valid,
as most tags relate to entity names or variations. In total,
12,106 entities could be successfully mapped to tags as well
as corresponding queries in the MSN query logs and 12,170
in the AOL logs.
From Table 1, which shows the top 10 entities with highest frequency in the MSN logs and a recall of greater than
0.5 on Delicious, a certain bias towards rather technical and
Internet related entities can be observed (R2). A bias to a
certain, less popular type of entities could also be affirmed
by counting numbers and recall values for entities of different popularities as shown in Figure 2: Even though all of the
most popular entities could be mapped to tags in Delicious,
their recall is relatively low. However, the highest presence
in Delicious was not among the least popular entities either,
but among those that were queried by up to 100 search sessions in the MSN logs. Also, the highest recall values were
reached for the long-tail as well, rather than for the more

TEMPORAL SEARCH

So far, none of the presented analyses has taken into account the temporal aspect, although our ultimate goal was to
evaluate the applicability of Delicious as external data source
for temporal Web archive search. Thus we wanted to know,

given the fairly good recalls achieved before, are the URLs
spread across the entire dataset or focused around the query
times of the available logs. Figure 4 presents these temporal
recall results. To get comparable values, we queried Delicious
with the same approach as before just only around the time
spans of the logs, i.e., May 2006 for MSN (0) and March (-2)
to May 2006 (0) for AOL. The x-axis in the figures denotes
the time difference in months up to one year in the future
and the past.
Notable is that in all plots, up to a difference of around
three months, the recall grows faster by relaxing the search
interval to the past. However, from the third month on
the recall gain is higher by expanding the search interval
to the future. This suggests posts on Delicious are lagging
slightly behind the queries in the considered search engines.
Overall the results are a slightly higher w.r.t. the AOL query
logs, which, however, may be due to the fact that it spans
three months instead of one, covered by MSN. Hence, in
May Delicious is already two months ahead of AOL. This
corresponds to the observation that the recall w.r.t. MSN
for three months from 0 to 2 approximately matches the
recall w.r.t. AOL in month 0. Overall, the recall results
come very close to what we observed in Figure 3. While we
achieved a full recall for the top 2,000 entities from the entire
dataset, already a search span of two years, 12 month in the
future and 12 in the past, is sufficient to retrieve 95% w.r.t.
MSN and even more than 95% w.r.t. AOL, as presented in
Figure 4c. Even more intriguing, we only lose about 10%
of recall by searching as little as two months in the past
and three months in the future (R4). However, in favor
of Delicious was the fact that the platform was relatively
popular during the analyzed time. Thus, the results might
be lower today and call for alternative datasets.

top queries, which exhibit the best recall results, a full recall
of 100% could be retained up to the top 2000 of all of the
about 12,100 analyzed entities. The top 50%, approx. 6000
entities, still result in a recall of almost 80% on average.
As a second analysis of the paper, we investigated temporal recall values with respect to the time spans of the
query logs around May 2006. It has shown that most of the
websites of interest w.r.t. the query logs also appeared on
Delicious around one year before and after the query times.
Already five months around the query time result only in a
little loss of recall. This indicates that Delicious is applicable
for temporal search as it appears to resemble query logs of
the past. The next step in this endeavor will be to create an
appropriate retrieval model that ranks the URLs according
to their relevance as derived by the query logs. Eventually,
our goal is to incorporate different sources, such as different
social networks as well as external websites from the Web
archive itself, that cover the missing entities over time for a
more complete Web archive search.

CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK

In this work we introduced the idea of using external data
sources with explicit temporal information for Web archive
search. We investigated the applicability of the social bookmarking service Delicious as a resource for this task and have
shown that it indeed serves as a suitable dataset for a certain kind of entity queries. It is crucial to keep in mind the
bias of any dataset used with the presented approach, as
obviously only queries supported by the dataset can lead to
satisfying results. It turns out, the best represented entities among the most popular ones on Delicious are from the
technical or Internet domain. Nevertheless, even overall we
reached a promising recall of 46% to 48% w.r.t. the analyzed query logs from MSN and AOL. By focusing on the
