ABSTRACT
In the research of building emotion lexicons, we witness the
exploitation of crowd-sourced aﬀective annotation given by
readers of online news articles. Such approach ignores the
relationship between topics and emotion expressions which
are often closely correlated. We build an emotion lexicon by
developing a novel joint non-negative matrix factorization
model which not only incorporates crowd-annotated emotion labels of articles but also generates the lexicon using
the topic-speciﬁc matrices obtained from the factorization
process. We evaluate our lexicon via emotion classiﬁcation
on both benchmark and built-in-house datasets. Results
demonstrate the high-quality of our lexicon.

seed selection. Today, many news websites (e.g., rappler.
com, corriere.it, etc.) allow users to express their feelings
about an article with a simple click on a given set of emoticons. Figure 1 shows the emotion distribution based on
such kind of votes from the crowd regarding an article on
rappler.com via an GUI called “mood meter” which is embedded in each of its web page.
Staiano and Guerini [14] proposed a compositional semantics method that utilized crowd-based aﬀective annotation, where they represented words and emotions in a
high-dimensional space based on their occurrences in the
document. A deﬁciency is that they ignored the versatility
of aﬀections among various contexts. It cannot distinguish
accurately the emotion of words by disregarding diﬀerent
topics where words exist. Since documents and topics are
of many-to-many correspondence in a collection, it would
be more useful to consider emotions at topic level. Some
researchers tried to model topic and sentiment simultaneously [4, 8] for joint sentiment-topic analysis. However, no
work has considered topics when building emotion lexicons.
Intuitively, emotion expressions are pertinent to the topics in which they reside. For example, “predictable” suggests
happiness for stock market, but for a movie it implies disappointment or even anger. We expect that topic-assisted
workaround can produce ﬁner-grained and more accurate entries for emotion lexicons. In this paper, we develop a novel
joint non-negative matrix factorization model which associates words with emotions in a low-dimensional semantic
space based on hidden topics. An emotion lexicon is built
from word-topic and emotion-topic factor matrices, which
result from the joint model, using matrix composition.

INTRODUCTION

A basic task in sentiment analysis is classifying the sentiment polarity (positive or negative) of the given subjective
text [8, 11, 13]. However, the binary scheme may be oversimpliﬁed. Recently, emotion analysis represents a natural
evolution of sentiment analysis by modeling ﬁner-grained
emotions, e.g., happy, sad, angry, etc. [9, 14].
Emotion lexicons are the essential resources for emotion
analysis. Compared to sentiment lexicons such as SentiWordNet1 [1], where each entry is typically labeled with
sentiment polarity, emotion lexicons are more complex in
the sense that each entry may convey a mixture of multiple
emotions which bear diﬀerent emotion intensity2 [14].
Most of the existing lexicon construction approaches [3,
12, 15] are based upon a set of hand-coded seed words. Consequently, the quality of lexicons is sensitive to the manual

RELATED WORK

Emotion lexicons are typically built based on a set of seed
words [3, 12, 14, 15]. Xu et al. [15] proposed a graph-based
algorithm which ranked words according to a few manually
selected seed words. Song et al. [12] and Feng et al. [3]
improved this method by supplementing seed words with
graphical emoticons or combined their eﬀects. Diﬀerently,
Staiano and Guerini [14] proposed a compositional semantics method using crowd-annotated articles crawled from the
Internet. In this paper, we also resort to crowd-annotated
articles while we incorporate topic-emotion relationship for
lexicon construction which was not considered previously.
Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has been widely
used in image or text representation. Lee and Seung [5] investigated the properties of the algorithm and emphasized
the clustering aspect. Xu et al. [16] applied standard NMF
to document clustering. In recent years, diﬀerent extensions [7, 10] have been proposed for solving sentiment analysis and sentiment lexicon construction. Li et al. [7] creatively
applied orthogonal NMF, proposed by Ding et al. [2], to
sentiment classiﬁcation by incorporating lexical prior knowledge. Peng and Park [10] proposed a constrained symmetric
NMF method for sentiment lexicon construction, which considers synonyms and antonyms simultaneously.
Lee et al. [6] used a generic semi-supervised NMF (SSNMF) method which jointly incorporates the data matrix
and the (partial) class label matrix into NMF. We base our
model on SSNMF for lexicon construction by incorporating
diﬀerent factorization schemes for the supervision matrix,
which naturally results in a lexicon from the estimated factor matrices. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst attempt for
building ﬁne-grained emotion lexicon based on NMF models.

J = ||U  (X − AS)||2 + α||V  (Y − BS)||2

where α is a tradeoﬀ parameter adjusting the importance
and B ∈ Rc×k

+
+
sis matrices for X and Y, U and V are weights matrices,
both of which can be ﬁxed as all-ones matrices to make an
NMF that fully uses labeled data [6]. Notation ||.||2 denotes
the squared sum of all the elements in the matrix and 
represents element-wise product.

4. OUR JOINT NMF MODEL
Inspired from SSNMF, we can jointly model the hidden
topics and the explicit crowd-based emotions of articles by
customizing the factorization process. Let T = {t1 , ..., t|T | }
be a set of topics in low-dimensional space with |T | 
min{|D|, |W |}. Given the word-document matrix MW D and
document-emotion matrix MDE , we decompose them based
on equation 2 by minimizing:

J = ||MW D −MW T M
DT || +α||MDE −MET MDT || (3)

to learn the three topic-speciﬁc factor matrices MW T , MDT
and MET , where MET represents the strength that emotions are associated with topics. Then, we can get the word
emotion distributions by using a variant of compositional
semantics approach (see equation 1) as below:
MW E = MW T M

PRELIMINARIES

(4)

A deﬁciency of directly applying SSNMF is that the emotion modeling is still coarse-grained for lexicon construction
which is concerned about word-level emotion. We enhance
the model by modeling the emotions of subjective texts using
a weighted linear combination of emotion words, which will
result in an additional term of the 3-factor decomposition of
MDE based on formula 3 as follow:

We ﬁrst introduce a compositional semantics method [14]
for building an emotion lexicon from crowd-annotated news.
Then, we review semi-supervised NMF [6] which paves the
way for developing our lexicon generation method.

3.1 Compositional Semantics Method (CS)
Let D = {d1 , . . . , d|D| } be a set of documents, and W =
{w1 , . . . , w|W | } be the complete vocabulary set of the whole
corpus. We deﬁne a word-document matrix MW D of size
|W | × |D|, using (w, d) as index and MW D (w,d) as entry
value based on raw frequencies f, normalized frequencies nf
or tf-idf. Given emotion set E = {e1 , . . . , e|E| }, we can
represent emotion labels from crowd-annotated resources as
a document-emotion matrix MDE of size |D| × |E| whose
entry values are based on crowd-sourced aﬀective annotation (see Figure 1). Staiano and Guerini [14] built a wordemotion matrix MW E using the compositional semantics
(CS) method by multiplying matrices MW D and MDE :
MW E = MW D MDE

(2)


2
J  = J + β||MDE − M
W D MW T MET ||

(5)

where β is a tradeoﬀ parameter, MW D is ﬁxed and considered as word weights, and MW T and MET are variables
whose product happens to be MW E . With the last term,
the joint model aims to improve the estimation of the topicspeciﬁc factor matrices by approximating the documentlevel emotions MDE based on the word-level emotions MW E .
Computation: Factor matrices MW T , MET and MDT are
ﬁrst randomly initialized, and then updated iteratively by
the following updating formulas:
MW T ← MW T 

(1)

An emotion lexicon can be obtained by ﬁrst applying columnwise normalization to MW E and then scaling its row-wise
data that sums up to one.

MET ← MET 

MW T MTDT MDT + βMW W MW T MTET MET

αMTDE MDT + βMTW E MW T

Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) [5] is an unsupervised algorithm widely used in image or text representation. A generic semi-supervised NMF (SSNMF) algorithm [6] was proposed to incorporate the data matrix

MTW D MW T + αMDE MET
MDT MTW T MW T + αMDT MTET MET

where MW W = MW D MTW D , MW E = MW D MDE , and the
divisions are all element-wise. The update formulas can be
easily induced based on the derivatives in [6].

Table 2: Emotion distribution over Rappler dataset
(1) A benchmark dataset from SemEval-20075 on identifying “Aﬀective Text”, which contains 1k annotated headlines.
As SemEval-2007 test set consists of only six emotions, we
adopted an emotion mapping method as displayed in Table 3 to map them to our pre-deﬁned emotions in the lexicon. (2) A built-in-house dataset with total 31k headlines
of the crawled Rappler articles.
We implement the algorithms using Matlab and run them
on a high performance Linux cluster.

Lexicon Construction: Given MW T and MET represented
in the |T |-dimensional topic space, we can build a wordemotion matrix MW E based on equation 4. After normalizing its entries, we obtain a |E|-dimensional vector for each
word w:

5.2 Experiments and Results
We evaluate the quality of the emotion lexicons in two
ways: (1) we examine the quality of lexicons created by our
method and other competitive methods using the crawled
Rappler news articles via an emotion classiﬁcation task; (2)
we compare our created lexicons with publicly available stateof-the-art lexicons in similar size.

(w,e)

ization term for w (column-wise normalization ensures that
diﬀerent columns for all the emotions are comparable).
Our created emotion lexicon contains 31,806 entries in total. Table 1 presents several example entries. Similar to [14],
we lemmatize and Part-of-Speech (PoS) tag all the documents (PoS we considered are adjective, noun, verb and adverb), and we only keep those lemma#P oS entries in the
lexicon which also appear in WordNet for eliminating noise
words. We can see that each entry has at least one main
emotion (e.g., monitor#v has two main emotions of afraid
and angry), and our lexicon diﬀerentiates the emotions better by assigning discriminative weighting scores as compared
to the CS baseline.

5.2.1 Parameter Setting
We tune the number of topics |T | by performing a grid
search over all values of 10 ∗ x with x ∈ {1, 2, ..., 30}. The
tradeoﬀ parameters α and β are tuned over all values in
{0.1, 1, 10, 100}. The tuning is based on the performance of
emotion classiﬁcation on the headlines in SemEval’s trial set
and a held-out set which consists of 20% headlines randomly
selected from the Rappler articles. Finally, we set |T | = 250,
α = 1 and β = 10. We set the number of iterations as 300,
which is large enough for ensuring convergence according to
our observation on the drop of J and J  values.

EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION

5.1 Data Resources

5.2.2 Comparison of Lexicon Building Methods

To build our lexicon, we crawled 31, 107 English news articles published before 2015-11-06 from rappler.com. We
used Standford CoreNLP3 , an integrated suite of natural
language processing tools, to tokenize, PoS tag and lemmatize all text data. In Table 2, we report the average percentage of votes for each emotion over all the documents in the
corpus. From Table 2, we ﬁnd that the emotion of happy has
a lot more votes than the others, which reﬂects that readers’ emotion preference is consistent to the general observation – positive sentiment dominates in real-world data. The
crawled resources and generated lexicons have been made
publicly available4 .
To evaluate the lexicon, we applied it for emotion classiﬁcation on news headlines as [14] did. We used two datasets:

For emotion classiﬁcation, we use a straight-forward votingbased algorithm [12, 14] to assign emotion labels to a test
headline h. We conduct element-wise sum over the emotion words in the headline by looking up the lexicon and
then average the sums by word counts, i.e., V h = Z1 <
h




w MW E (w,1) , ...,
w MW E (w,|E|) > where Zh is the number of emotion words in h. We then normalize V h with the
min-max normalization and map each emotion element into
a binary decision with ﬁxed thresholds. We set threshold at
0.5 for SemEval-2007 test set and 0.35 for Rappler test set,
empirically6 . We use F-1 measure to assess the classiﬁcation
performance on each emotion. Tables 4 and 5 show the re5

http://nlp.cs.swarthmore.edu/semeval/tasks/
We set a lower threshold for Rappler test set since only a
single emotion in each news receives more than 50% votes

sults by averaging 20 independent runs (with random initial
matrices) on SemEval and Rappler test sets, respectively.
Our joint models perform better than CS for most emotions especially under nf conﬁguration. This indicates that
normalized frequency can prevent the bias towards long documents and our method considering topic is eﬀective. Moreover, joint model J  also performs J at most cases, implying the usefulness of considering word-level emotion in
decomposition. Surprisingly, the results under tf-idf conﬁguration are unstable, which suggests that introducing idf is
sub-optimal. This is because frequent emotion words, e.g.,
“good”, receive low tf ∗ idf , thus are not learned well.

5.2.3 Comparison with Available Emotion Lexicons
We compare our lexicons with the original lexicons released by Staiano and Guerini [14]. We assess them via
emotion classiﬁcation on the larger built-in-house Rappler
test set. Figure 2 demonstrates that our lexicon conﬁgured
as nf achieves the best results on nearly all emotions, which
suggests the high usability of our created lexicon.

CONCLUSIONS

We present a joint NMF method which incorporates crowdbased emotion labels on articles and generates topic-speciﬁc
factor matrices for building emotion lexicons via compositional semantics. Experiments conducted on the benchmark
and built-in-house datasets demonstrate our method outperforms the competitive methods on emotion classiﬁcation.
Moreover, our created lexicon outperforms the competitive
counterpart on emotion classiﬁcation task. Our future work
will study emotion-speciﬁc word embeddings for lexicon construction using deep learning.
