ABSTRACT

gathered from several sources in parallel to create a single stream
of constantly arriving news. The problem of first story detection is
to identify the stories in a stream of news that contain discussion of
a new topic, i.e. whose event has not been previously reported [6].
FSD has been recognized as the most difficult task in the research
area of TDT [11]. In early work, Allen et al. detect first stories as
news articles whose cosine similarity over tf-idf vectors to its nearest neighbor is less than a threshold, an effective approach that outperforms complex language model approaches in most cases [1].
This baseline is still used for FSD in recent work, in which more
focus is put on efficiency than to improve effectiveness [3, 5, 4].
Papka and Allen, argue that a side-effect of the timely nature of
broadcast news is that stories closer together on the news stream are
more likely to discuss related topics than stories farther apart on the
stream. When a significant new event occurs, there are usually several stories per day discussing it; over time, coverage of old events
is displaced by more recent events. They use temporal proximity
as a distinguishing feature to incorporate the salient properties of
broadcast news [2, 6].
In recent work, Vuurens et al. proposed a novel 3-nearest neighbor clustering (3NN) approach to retrieve sentences from news articles that contain novel and useful news facts. In this approach
every text is linked to its three nearest neighbors that must be from
a different domain [10]. The so-called ‘2-degenerate cores’ constructed by the algorithm correspond to highly similar texts from
three different sources. Their existence indicates the importance or
salience of the information contained. Temporal proximity is incorporated in the model by weighting the time between news articles
in the similarity function used. In [9] normalized information gain
is shown to be more effective than cosine similarity for the task of
clustering news articles that are topically related.

First Story Detection (FSD) systems aim to identify those news articles that discuss an event that was not reported before. Recent
work on FSD has focussed almost exclusively on efficiently detecting documents that are dissimilar from their nearest neighbor.
We propose a novel FSD approach that is more effective, by adapting a recently proposed method for news summarization based on
3-nearest neighbor clustering. We show that this approach is more
effective than a baseline that uses dissimilarity of an individual document from its nearest neighbor.

INTRODUCTION

Internet users are turning more frequently to online news as a replacement for traditional media sources such as newspapers or television. For the user, the news stream is a source to both track topics
of interest and to become informed about important new events the
user was not yet aware of. Automated detection of new events can
save to user a great deal of time, for instance by notifying users
about new events, which is especially interesting to users and organizations for whom the information is time-critical and who need
to act on that information.
FSD systems aim to identify those news articles that discuss an
event that was not reported before in earlier stories, without knowledge of what events will happen in the news [2]. Recently, FSD has
been suggested as a useful tool to monitor the Twitter feed [7], and
while previous work has addressed the efficiency that is required
for this purpose, there has been little work on improving the effectiveness in over a decade [7, 8].
In this study, we propose a novel approach that is more effective
that the widely used function proposed by Allen et al. that declares
a story new if it is dissimilar to its nearest neighbor [1].

The task of detecting events can be automated using information about the events published online. For this purpose, the Topic
Detection and Tracking (TDT) program was initiated to discuss applications and techniques to organize broadcast news stories by the
real world events that they discuss in real-time. News stories are

METHOD

In this work, we adapt the 3NN clustering approach to First Story
Detection, by clustering news articles rather than sentences, and
using a similarity function based on normalized information gain to
promote the clustering of news articles that are likely to be topically
related.

Single Linkage

We compare our efforts to the approach described by Allen et
al. [1], which is considered a state-of-the-art approach in recent
studies on First Story Detection, e.g. [7, 4]. In this approach, documents are represented as tf-idf weighted vectors, and the novelty
of a document d is estimated by the cosine similarity to its nearest
neighbor n in the collection C [1]:

n∈C

Lastly, we add a threshold to filter out newly formed clusters
that are less likely to be topically related to each other. Vuurens et
al. show that news articles that have a high normalized information
gain are rarely topically related [9]. Following their findings, we filter out clusters that fail the coherence criterium in Equation 5, that
enforces that the similarity between all nodes d, d 0 that are members of the same 2-degenerate core A exceeds a threshold φcoherence ,
for which different settings are tried to examine the sensitivity and
impact on effectiveness.

Then, a news article is marked as a first story when its novelty is
below a threshold α ∈ [0, 1].

3.2

3NN First Story Detection

In this study, we propose a novel approach that is based on 3nearest neighbor clustering (3NN), using the existing open source
implementation [10]. In 3NN clustering, every node is assigned
to its three nearest neighbors, not allowing links between nodes
from the same news domain, and based on temporal proximity between publication dates which allows the clustering to be continuously updated in near real-time. 2-generate cluster cores are formed
when three nodes each link to the other two as a one of its 3 nearest
neighbors. These clusters contain information that is locally most
central and therefore likely to be salient information [10]. The key
idea for First Story Detection, is that acting on formed 3NN clusters
rather than individual documents is less likely to return false positives. However, instead of truly detecting the first story as was the
objective in the TDT program, here we aim to improve detection
performance at the expense of slightly delayed detection. It may
also be that the story detected as the first of a new event is more
central to the information, and therefore more suitable as a seed to
start tracking a topic, however, this hypothesis is outside the scope
of this study and left for future work.
In [9], news sentences were fitted into a hierarchy that distinguishes between different events and topics by forming clusters of
topically related the news articles, for which normalized information gain was shown to be more effective than cosine similarity.
Therefore, to promote 3NN clusters to be formed around topically
related news articles we use a similarity function based on normalized information gain. In Equation 2, the normalized information
gain between two documents d and d 0 results in a score of 0 between identical documents and a score of 1 between disjoint documents, by dividing the information gain IG between the documents
by an upper bound of the information gain IGmax that would be obtained if these documents have the same internal distributions over
terms but are completely disjoint. For the remainder of this paper we use IGsim as defined in Equation 3 as a similarity function
between two documents d, d 0 based on IGnorm .
IGnorm (d, d 0 ) =

IG(d, d 0 )
IGmax (d, d 0 )

IGsim (d, d 0 ) = 1 − IGnorm (d, d 0 )

Test set

For the evaluation, we use the TREC Temporal Summarization
test sets of 2013 and 2014. The corpus for these test sets is the
2013 TREC KBA Streaming corpus, which contains approx. 150M
news articles that are processed in a strict online setting. Table 1
shows the topics from the test sets, which are all types of a crisis
that received continuous updates in the media over time. Arguably,
the news regarding a single topic could be considered to be all part
of the same story, or in some cases be regarded as separate stories
within a topic. Here we regard all news articles that are matched to
the same topic as part of one news story, for which ideally only the
first article should be returned. TREC assessors annotated the sentences that TREC participants retrieved as relevant if they contain
a news fact relevant to the topic.
The basis for the evaluation of the FSD systems is a list per topic
of all documents that contain relevant news facts according to the
TREC ground truth or the online published extended lists that contain duplicate sentences found in the collection. For the combined
23 topics, there are 65,358 documents that were annotated as containing relevant information. For this task, a returned news article
is considered as a first for a topic when it is the first relevant article
returned by the system, and a false alarm when another relevant article for the same topic was returned earlier. News articles that are
not marked as relevant to the topic are ignored in the evaluation.

3.4

Experiment setup and evaluation metrics

The effectiveness of First Story Detection systems is measured
by the miss rate, false alarm rate, recall and precision, which we
explain using the contingencies in Table 2. For any topic, we only
consider articles that are annotated as relevant for the topic, thus if
T is the number of documents annotated as relevant for the topic,
then T P + FN + FP + T N = T . Since there can only be one first
story per topic per system, T P + FN = 1 and FP + T N = T − 1.
A miss occurs when the system fails to detect a new event, i.e.
FN
. A false alarm occurs when the system emits
miss rate = T P+FN
a news article when a first story was already emitted for that topic,
FP
i.e. f alse alarm rate = FP+T
N . Recall is the fraction of topics
TP
for which a first story was detected Recall = T P+FN
, and Precision is the fraction of retrieved news articles that is a fist story
TP
Precision = T P+FP
, which here only considers the news articles
that are relevant to the topic.

From the obtained 3NN clustering, the newly formed 2-degenerate
cores are inspected for first stories. Similar to the Single Linkage
baseline, first stories are detected when a newly formed cluster core
is dissimilar from news articles seen recently. In 3NN every news
article is linked to its three nearest neighbors, therefore the members of a newly formed 2-degenerate core that contains a first story
each have two links to the other core members and the third link
links to a dissimilar news article. The most similar non-core news
article that a core member links to, is then used to estimate the novelty of that cluster core. Formally, in Equation 4 a cluster core A
is declared novel when the similarity between a news article d ∈ A
and a news article n in the remainder of the collection C is below a
threshold φnovelty .

In this Section, we compare the effectiveness of first story detection using Single Linkage (SL) to FSD using 3NN.

Effectiveness

In Figure 1, a DET curve shows the relationship between miss
rate and false alarm rates. Overall, the 3NN runs perform better
than SL, regardless of the setting used for φcoherence . In Figure 2,
we show a tradeoff between recall and precision, which further supports that 3NN is consistently more effective than Single Linkage.
Table 3 gives the precision and false alarm rate when the novelty
thresholds for both systems are set to the highest precision that can
be obtained at recall = 1. When α = 0.48 and φnovelty = 0.6 are
set to allow for the lowest false alarm rate at a missed rate of 0
(i.e. recall=1), precision is respectively 0.0149 for SL and 0.0618
for 3NN, meaning that SL more redundantly retrieves 4 times more
news articles for the same event.

Precision

Figure 2: Plotted point show the Recall/Precision that correspond
to the systems’ effectiveness at the given threshold.

Some topics are related to an incident that is followed by a quick
burst (e.g. topic 1), while other topics initially have a phase of little
media attention and have intervals of increased interest later in time
(e.g. topic 16). An interesting case is topic 18, which concerns the
demonstrations that followed the Russian elections. For this topic,
the news slowly shifted over the cause of days from a focus on
the election itself to the steadily increasing demonstrations. This
gradual shift towards a new topic is relatively difficult to detect for
the approaches used in this study. The effective detection of these
types of event may require a novel FSD approach that is not solely
based on dissimilarity.
An inspection on the timeliness of the first stories detected reveals weaknesses in both approaches, and potentially an important
aspect that should be taken into consideration in attempts to improve FSD. Timeliness of the detection is currently not addressed
by the traditional evaluations that use a DET-curve and the tradeoff between recall and precision. To evaluate future work that ad-

Timeliness

In Figure 3, the y-axis shows the aggregated number of relevant
news articles per hour over time on the x-axis. In this Figure, we
can visually compare the moment a first story was detected against
the volume of published news articles. We can see that the systems occasionally missed early detection, e.g. 3NN for topic 3, and
Single Linkage for topic 9. On topic 12, detection may be late for
3NN, but there is a difficult tradeoff between early detection and a
lower false alarm rate.

FSD approaches is required.

CONCLUSION

In this study, we propose a novel approach for the task of First
Story Detection based on clustering news articles that are likely to
be topically related, and estimating the novelty of newly formed
clusters by comparison to previously seen news articles. We compared this approach to a baseline that estimates the novelty of a
single news article by the cosine similarity to its nearest neighbor. The evaluation shows that the proposed model outperforms
the existing baseline both in tradeoff between missed first stories
and false positives, and in tradeoff between recall and precision.
An analysis of the timeliness of the first story detections revealed
that both systems missed early detection on some cases, and that
there are specific cases such as evolving events that are particularly
hard to detect.
