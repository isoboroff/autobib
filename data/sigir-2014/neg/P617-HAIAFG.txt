ABSTRACT

1. INTRODUCTION

Online reviews are immensely valuable for customers to make
informed purchase decisions and for businesses to improve
the quality of their products and services. However, customer reviews grow exponentially while varying greatly in
quality. It is generally very tedious and difficult, if not impossible, for users to read though the huge amount of review
data for decision-making. Fortunately, review quality evaluation enables a system to recommend automatically the
most helpful reviews to users. Previous studies predict only
the overall review utility about a product, and often focus on
developing different data features to learn a quality function
for the problem. In this paper, we aim to select the most
helpful reviews not only at the product level, but also at a
fine-grained product aspect level. We propose a novel supervised joint aspect and sentiment model (SJASM), which is a
probabilistic topic modeling framework that jointly discovers aspects and sentiments guided by a review helpfulness
metric. One key advantage of SJASM is its ability to infer
the underlying aspects and sentiments, which are indicative
of the helpfulness of a review. We validate SJASM using
publicly available review data, and our experimental results
demonstrate the superiority of SJASM over several competing models.

Nowadays, customers readily create textual reviews to
share their hands-on experiences and opinions on the purchased products or services on websites such as Amazon 1 .
Online reviews are immensely valuable because: 1) They
have become an inevitable part of the decision making process on product purchases, hotel bookings, etc. According
to a survey, a massive 88% of respondents agreed that they
“sometimes or always” consult customer reviews prior to
making a purchase 2 ; and 2) They collectively form a lowcost and efficient feedback channel for businesses to keep
track of their reputation and customer sentiments, which
can be used to improve the quality of their products and
services.
However, customer reviews are constantly growing in quantity, while varying greatly in quality or helpfulness. A popular product can easily accumulate hundreds or even thousands of online reviews within a very short period of time.
For instance, the book “Harry Potter and the Half-Blood
Prince” on Amazon had received 4,193 customer reviews by
January 24, 2014. Among the large number of reviews, the
helpful and high-quality reviews are usually intermixed with
the useless ones. It is thus practically impossible for users to
read through such large number of reviews for good decisionmaking.
Some existing e-commerce websites already provide a crowdsource mechanism to evaluate review quality. For instance,
Amazon allows customers to vote each product review as
helpful or unhelpful. As a matter of fact, a good many of
reviews of the unpopular products receive very few or no
votes at all. As a result, decisions made using the online
sparse voting information alone tend to suffer from bias,
and are perhaps unreliable. Moreover, no websites currently
provide a mechanism for assessing the review utility at the
fine-grained aspect level.
By formulating the review utility prediction simply as a
regression or classification problem, previous studies mainly
focus on defining data features, on which a review utility
function can be then learnt [7, 20, 11, 13, 3]. Further, all
the existing approaches are proposed for review utility prediction at the product level. In other words, the approaches
cannot be used to detect product aspects and therefore to
select the most useful reviews at the fine-grained product
aspect level. In reality, savvy consumers not only want to
read the most helpful reviews for a product, but also are

eager to know what aspects are evaluated in reviews, and
which reviews are the most useful for learning the individual
aspects of the reviewed product. Such fine-grained review
utility information may very well tip the balance in customer
purchase decisions. Additionally, in opinion summarization
system, incorporating the selected useful reviews with the
summarized compact sentiment analysis results could provide much more informative first-hand experiences to users.
In this work, we focus on the problem of review helpfulness/utility prediction and review selection from coarse
grain (product-level) to fine grain (aspect-level), namely,
coarse-to-fine review selection. In particular, we study three
closely related problems as described below:

model called SJASM. One key advantage of SJASM is
its ability to infer the hidden aspects and sentiments
which are indicative of the helpfulness voting of a review.
• We employ SJASM to address the coarse-to-fine review
recommendation problem. As far as we know, our approach is the first to apply topic modeling technique
to the problem of review helpfulness/utility prediction
and review selection.

2. RELATED WORK
2.1 Review Utility Prediction

1. Overall review helpfulness prediction. We predict the
overall review helpfulness scores at the product level,
and select the most helpful reviews for each product
in terms of the scores.

Previous work typically focuses on manually coming up
with data features, and then formulating review helpfulness/utility prediction as a regression or classification problem on these features.
Kim et al. [7] proposed to utilize five classes of textual
features to estimate the helpfulness of a review. They found
that the most useful features were the length of review, unigrams, and ratings. Zhang and Varadarajan [20] built regression models by incorporating a diverse set of textual
features. They claimed that the shallow syntactic features
turned out to be the most influential predictors, which indicates that the utility of a review highly depends on its
linguistic style. To predict the helpfulness of online reviews,
Liu et al. [12] used a regression model based on the data features like the reviewer’s expertise, the review writing style,
and the timeliness of a review. Ghose and Ipeirotis [3] proposed to exploit the text-related features, such as subjectivity, readability, and linguistic correctness, to estimate the
helpfulness of product reviews. Two other classificationbased approaches were developed to recommend the most
helpful reviews by filtering out the low-quality ones in [11,
16]. Further, to improve the textual feature based review
quality predictor, Lu et al. [13] proposed to exploit social
contextual information about reviewers’ identities and social
networks.
All of the aforementioned existing studies focus on only
predicting the review helpfulness/utility/quality with regard
to a whole reviewed product, with the objective to recommend/select the most helpful reviews at the product level.
However, when faced with fine-grained aspect-level helpful
review selection problem, the previous studies may become
useless.

2. Aspect detection. We detect the individual product aspects that are evaluated in customer reviews, in order
to address the fine-grained review selection problem.
3. Aspect-based review utility estimation. For each detected product aspect, we estimate the aspect-based
review utility scores, and then recommend the most
useful reviews for the aspect in terms of the scores.
It is observed that online customer reviews often come
with helpfulness voting, for instance, in the form of “x of y
people found the following review helpful” on Amazon. Typically, a customer review is helpful in the sense that the
review: 1) mentions the particular attributes, components,
or aspects of a commented product, and 2) expresses pertinent sentiments, opinions, and evaluations on such specific
aspects. We propose to model the helpfulness voting of a
review in a unified framework to supervise the inference process of underlying aspects and sentiments in the review. In
addition, the vast majority of existing topic modeling approaches use the bag-of-words (BOW) representation of a
document. Differently, we reduce each review document as
a bag of opinion pairs (BOOP), and then model each pair of
aspect term and its associated opinion word simultaneously
in the unified framework.
We propose a novel supervised joint aspect and sentiment model (SJASM), which is a probabilistic topic modeling framework that jointly detects aspects and sentiments
from reviews under the supervision of the helpfulness voting
data. One key advantage of SJASM is that it can discover
the underlying sentimental aspects which are predictive of
the review helpfulness voting. We then apply it to the review helpfulness/utility prediction to address the coarse-tofine review selection problem. We evaluate SJASM using
three publicly available review collections, and experimentally show the improved effectiveness of the proposed model
against benchmark models.
We summarize our contributions as follows:

2.2 Probabilistic Topic Models

• We define a new problem in opinion mining field, namely,
aspect-based review selection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that addresses the review
utility prediction and helpful review selection with regard to individual aspects of a reviewed product.
• By incorporating the helpfulness voting into a unified
framework, we propose a novel supervised joint topic

618

Topic modeling algorithms aim to uncover the hidden topical structure of a document collection [2, 5]. Blei et al.
[2] proposed the first latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), in
which a document is modeled as a mixture over a latent set
of topics, where each topic is modeled by a distribution over
words. Based on LDA, many other topic models have been
developed to address review mining problems.
Titov and McDonald [17] developed a joint topic model of
text and aspect ratings, called multi-aspect sentiment model
(MAS). MAS can identify latent topics in customer reviews
and extract textual evidence from the reviews supporting
each of the aspect ratings. But the assumption of MAS that
every aspect-based sentiment rating is present in review data
may lead to its limited use in reality. This is because a large
quantity of online reviews have not been annotated with

aspects as well as the aspect-specific sentiment ratings by
customers.
Lin and He [9] extended LDA by designing a new sentiment layer, and proposed a joint sentiment-topic model
(JST), which is based on the assumption that topic generation depends on sentiments, and word generation is dependent on the sentiment-topic pairs. Lin et al. [10] then
extended JST by incorporating sentiment priors, and introduced a weakly supervised joint sentiment-topic model. The
supervision knowledge comes from a domain independent
sentiment lexicon. The weakly supervised JST model may
yield improved performance compared to the unsupervised
one, however suffers from two problems: 1) The inference
of the sentiment labels for the out-of-lexicon expressions becomes unsupervised, negating the supervised advantage; and
2) The detection of underlying topics is completely unsupervised.
Jo and Oh [6] proposed a sentence-LDA model, and then
extended the model to an aspect and sentiment unification
model (ASUM), which detects sentiments toward different
aspects in a unified framework. A sentiment lexicon was
also incorporated in the model. One limitation of ASUM is
its assumption that each review sentence contains exactly
one aspect is often violated when modeling the long and
complicated real-world reviews. Moghaddam and Ester [15]
developed an interdependent LDA model (ILDA) to jointly
detect hidden aspects and sentiments from product reviews.
Wang et al. [19] proposed a latent aspect rating analysis
model (LARAM) to discover latent aspects and their sentiment ratings. But one challenge that remains in LARAM
is the aspect segmentation, which may provide inaccurate
segments for the subsequent aspect-specific rating analysis
task.
All of the topic models mentioned above were introduced
primarily for classifying the sentiments on the latent aspects
in each review, but not for predicting the helpfulness of the
review. Though benefitting from the modeling of the subjective and objective information in individual reviews, they
cannot model the review helpfulness voting information in
their frameworks, and will be thus less successful for discovering the topical structure of review data for the review
helpfulness analysis tasks.
Blei and McAuliffe [1] developed a supervised latent Dirichlet allocation model (sLDA), a statistical model of labelled
documents. Though sLDA can be used to model the review
document and helpfulness voting pairs, it cannot discover
the sentiments expressed towards the hidden topics in reviews, simply due to no sentiment analysis module designed
in the structure.
Our supervised joint topic model SJASM is related to but
different from the aforementioned topic models. The incorporation of review helpfulness voting into the modeling
framework enables SJASM to exploit the supervision information to guide the inference process of underlying aspects
and aspect-specific sentiments in each review. One key advantage of our proposed model is the identified sentimental
aspects are predictive of review helpfulness response.

appears typically as noun or noun phrase in customer reviews. For example, in this review sentence, “The price is
too expensive for me”, the noun “price” is an aspect term.
Opinion Word: An opinion word o refers to the word
used to express subjectivity, opinion, and sentiment in a review. It occurs typically as an adjective in review sentences.
The adjective “expensive” in the above example is an opinion
word.
Aspect: An aspect a refers to a unique ratable attribute
or component of an entity. In our model setting, it is also
known as an underlying topic, and typically clusters a set
of semantically related aspect terms and opinion words. For
instance, we can infer a hidden aspect “price” via the opinion
word “pricey” in this sentence “It is really too pricey”.
Sentiment: A sentiment s refers to the opinion/sentiment
orientation expressed on the aspects of an entity or the entity itself. In our work it also indicates a sentimental cluster
which groups the opinion words with the same sentimental orientation. Typically, the sentiment orientation can be
represented in sentimental labels such as positive, negative,
and neutral, or in sentimental ratings like 1-to-5 star ratings. For instance, a negative sentiment is expressed on the
underlying aspect “price” via the opinion word “pricey” in
the above example.
Opinion Pair: An opinion pair op = ht, oi is defined as
a pair of aspect term t and its corresponding opinion word
o extracted from a customer review. For instance, we can
extract an opinion pair hprice, expensivei from this review
sentence “The price is really expensive for me”.
Helpfulness: The helpfulness h of a review indicates the
utility or usefulness of the review to fellow users for making
decisions.
Next, given a product from a category, there is a collection
of M customer reviews R = {r1 , r2 , . . . , rM } for the product,
where each review rm is reduced to a set of Nm opinion
pairs rm = {ht1 , o1 i, ht2 , o2 i, . . . , htNm , oNm i}. We define the
problems to be addressed in this work below:
Overall Review Helpfulness Prediction: This task
is to predict the overall helpfulness score hm of a review
rm with regard to a reviewed product. The most helpful
reviews will be then selected in terms of the scores hm for
the product itself.
Aspect Detection: This task aims to discover the K ratable product aspects ak evaluated in the collection of reviews
R, typically by clustering the synonymous or semantically
related keywords (aspect terms or opinion words) appearing
in the reviews. For example, the aspect “price” can be inferred from such semantically related keywords like “price”,
“cost” “pricey”, and “expensive”.
Aspect-based Review Utility Estimation: This task
is to estimate the fine-grained aspect-based utility score hmk
of the review rm with regard to a particular aspect ak . Then,
a list of useful reviews will be recommended based on the
utility scores hmk for the detected aspect ak .

4. PROPOSED MODEL
By incorporating the review helpfulness voting information into a unified framework, we propose a novel probabilistic graphical model called Supervised Joint Aspect and
Sentiment Model (SJASM) to address the problems defined
above. SJASM simultaneously models the pairwise aspect
terms and their corresponding opinion words in a review,
and jointly detects the underlying aspects and sentiments

PROBLEM DEFINITION

We define some terminologies, followed by the definitions
of the problems that we will address in this paper.
Aspect Term: An aspect term t indicates an attribute,
a component, or a feature of an entity (e.g., product), which

Based on the assumptions, to generate a review document
and the helpfulness response by SJASM, underlying aspects
are first generated conditioned on the document-specific aspect distribution. The sentiments are then generated conditioned on the generated aspects as well as the documentspecific sentiment distribution. Next, the aspect term and
opinion word in every opinion pair of the review are generated conditioned on their corresponding aspect and sentiment. Review helpfulness response is finally generated conditioned on the realized aspect and sentiment assignments
in the review.
The graphical model representation of SJASM is shown
in Figure 1, and the notations used in this model are listed
in Table 1. The generative process of the graphical model is
as follows:

(1)

In Equation 1, z̄m represents the combined empirical frequencies of the underlying aspects and sentiments in a review rm , where C is a normalization constant, and ω is
a weight vector for sentiment orientations (labels/ratings),
which can be obtained experimentally from data.
The real-valued helpfulness response hm is drawn from a
normal linear model, where the quantity z̄m works as the
covariates, and η indicates the regression coefficients, while
the parameters η T z̄m and σ 2 are the mean and variance
of the normal distribution. We regress the helpfulness response on the empirical frequencies of the hidden aspects
and sentiments generated in the review. This means that
the aspect terms and opinion words as well as their aspect
and sentiment assignments in the review are generated first,

620

The document-aspect sentiment distribution is computed
by:

then, based on the aspects and sentiments of the review, the
helpfulness response is generated.
The formulation agrees with the intuition that reviews
that clearly convey positive or negative evaluations on the
specific aspects of a product could be more constructive and
informed, and should be selected for use.

nk,l is the number of times unique opinion word v is assigned to sentiment l as well as to aspect k. The subscript
“−n” in a quantity indicates that the quantity excludes the

count of the unique aspect word u being assigned to aspect
k, excluding the aspect term instance of the word u and
the corresponding aspect assignment at the index n. The
notations in Equation 3 are listed in Table 1.
Based on the samples from the full conditional distribution, we compute document aspect distribution as below:

Given a new unlabeled review rm′ and a fitted model
{ψk , φkl , α, γ, λ, β, η, σ 2 }(k : 1, . . . , K; l : 1, . . . , L), our idea
for the overall review helpfulness prediction is to first infer
all the evaluated aspects of the product and their associated sentiments in the review, and then approximately form
the regression function on the posterior mean z̄m′ , as shown
below:
ĥm′ ≈ η T z̄m′ .

(10)

Note that we approximate the posterior mean of z̄m′ by
applying Gibbs sampling as described in the previous section. However, the terms relying on the helpfulness response
are removed from the sampling formula, as testing reviews
contain no helpfulness annotations.
We estimate the overall helpfulness scores of all the testing
reviews using Equation 10, and recommend the most helpful
reviews for the commented product to users for decisionmaking.

Previous work has shown that an asymmetric Dirichlet
prior over the document topic distribution has substantial
advantages over a symmetric prior, while an asymmetric
prior over the topic word distribution provides no real benefit [18]. We thus use an asymmetric prior α for the document
aspect distribution, while using symmetric priors λ and β for
the aspect word distribution and aspect-sentiment opinion
word distribution, respectively. Note we use symmetric prior
γ for the sentiment distribution. In particular, we apply a
fixed-point iteration scheme [14] for the estimation of the
prior α. The symmetric prior γ is set as 1/L, while both
priors λ and β are specified as the same value 0.01.
We follow Blei and McAuliffe [1] to approximately evaluate the normal linear model parameters η and σ 2 .
Let Z be the M × K matrix whose rows are the vectors

The exact inference for this distribution is intractable, due

play. Following Griffiths and Steyvers [4] we use a collapsed

SJASM.

5.2.2 Aspect-level Review Selection

Table 2: Some Statistics of Review Data Sets

As for the fine-grained aspect-level review selection, we
need to fix two problems, one is to detect aspects, the other
is to estimate the aspect-based utility score of each review.
The aspects are recognized via the aspect word distribution and aspect-sentiment opinion word distribution. Then,
for each aspect, we estimate the aspect-based review utility
score based on two criteria: document aspect distribution
and the predicted review helpfulness. This is because the
reviews to be recommended for an aspect are required to be
not only useful but also relevant to the aspect.
In particular, we approximate the aspect-based utility score
hm′k of the review rm′ for the aspect k by weighting the document aspect distribution θm′k with the predicted review
helpfulness ĥm′ , as given in the function below:

Amazon users are allowed to vote whether a review is helpful or not, and the helpfulness voting is represented in the
form “x of y people found the following review helpful”. In
our experiments, we used only the reviews with at least 10
votes (i.e., y ≥ 10) in order to conduct a fair and reliable
evaluation. We simply estimated the helpfulness h of a review as: h = x/y, and used the score as a golden standard
for the evaluation of overall review helpfulness prediction.
All reviews in each of the three data sets were analyzed
and parsed using the Stanford Parser [8]. We then simply applied the grammatical dependency relations adjectival modifier (“amod”), direct object (“dobj”), and nominal subject (“nsubj”) to opinion pair extraction from each
parsed review. We then extended the extracted set of opinion pairs via applying the dependency relations negation
modifier (“neg”) and conjunct (“conj”).
For each corpus we held out 20% of the data for testing
and trained all the models on the remaining 80% of the data.

(11)

We then recommend the most useful reviews for each aspect in terms of the estimated aspect-based utility scores.

EXPERIMENT RESULTS

We evaluated SJASM on the problem of review utility
prediction and coarse-to-fine review selection. In particular,
we conducted three types of experimental evaluations:
• Overall review helpfulness prediction. We predicted
overall helpfulness via SJASM, and selected the most
helpful reviews for a product in terms of the scores.

6.2 Overall Review Helpfulness Prediction
The fitted supervised SJASM and sLDA models were directly employed to form the overall review helpfulness prediction for unlabeled testing reviews. Since JST is weakly
supervised, we relied on a separate regression procedure on
the detected JST topics to do the prediction. We utilized
unigram textual features to learn LR model for prediction.

• Aspect detection. The aspects commented on in reviews were detected via SJASM, and were then evaluated qualitatively against baseline models.
• Aspect-based review utility estimation. The aspectbased review utility was estimated based on the review helpfulness and document (review) aspect distribution. The most useful and relevant reviews were
recommended for each detected aspect in terms of the
aspect-based utility scores.

6.2.1 Evaluation via Correlation
We first evaluated SJASM and the baseline models via
Pearson correlation versus the number of aspects (K) while
keeping the sentiment orientation count at 3 (L = 3).

We compared SJASM against three well-established benchmark models: a supervised topic model called supervised
latent Dirichlet allocation (sLDA) [1], a weakly supervised
topic model called joint sentiment-topic (JST) model [10], as
well as a classic linear regression model (LR). Note that: 1)
JST is weakly supervised in the sense that it incorporates a
pre-compiled sentiment lexicon to supervise the generation
of sentiment label, but for the topic/aspect detection, it is
unsupervised; and 2) LR is used only for the evaluation of
overall review helpfulness prediction, as it cannot discover
the latent topical structure of data.

6.2.2 Evaluation via MSE

SJASM outperforms benchmark models sLDA, JST, and
LR across all the numbers of aspects. The average correlation of SJASM over all the observations is 43.79%, which is
7.23%, 10.86%, and 25.36% better than that of sLDA, JST,
and LR, respectively. The curve of SJASM overall improves
with increasing number of aspects. The largest performance
gain of SJASM over sLDA is 12.47% at aspect number 30,
while the largest gain of SJASM over JST is 15.99% at aspect number 10.

Next, we used mean squared error (MSE) to evaluate
SJASM against baseline models for overall review helpfulness prediction, as shown in Table 3.
SJASM leads to consistently better prediction performance
in MSE (the lower, the better) across all six observations
on the Audio CD reviews. The largest performance gap
between SJASM and sLDA is found at aspect number 15,
where the MSE of sLDA increases by 7.8% with respect to
SJASM. The largest gap between SJASM and JST is located
at aspect number 10, where the MSE of JST increases by
15.2% over SJASM.
On the Video Games review category, the best performance gains of SJASM against the sLDA and JST are located at the same aspect number of 30, where the MSE values of sLDA and JST exceed by 15.3% and 23.4% compared
to the MSE of SJASM.
The best performance gaps of SJASM over sLDA and JST
on the Books category are found at the aspect numbers of
10 and 15, where the MSE values of sLDA and JST exceed
by 8.6% and 8.4% over SJASM, respectively.
The LR model results in MSE scores 0.0639, 0.0609, and
0.1862 on the Audio CD, Video Games, and Books categories, respectively, and loses out to SJASM for the overall
helpfulness prediction.
The experimental results again demonstrated the improved
effectiveness of SJASM compared to the benchmark models
sLDA, JST, and LR on the three review categories. The
main reasons for the improvement of SJASM over the benchmark models may lie in:

Figure 3: Correlation versus number of aspects on

Figure 3 plots the correlation of SJASM versus the benchmark models on Video Games reviews. SJASM again performs better than the baseline models. As the number of
aspects grows, the SJASM curve increases, exhibiting a similar trend as Figure 2. The average correlation of SJASM
across all the six observations is 46.53%, which is 8.65%,
11.30%, and 25.92% better than that of sLDA, JST, and
LR, respectively.

• By jointly modeling the aspects and the aspect-associated
sentiments, we can figure out which positive or negative aspects contribute to the final overall review helpfulness, while sLDA cannot mine such constructive
sentimental topics, simply due to the lack of sentiment
analysis module in its model structure.
• By modeling helpfulness voting as supervision information, the detected sentimental aspects by SJASM are
predictive of review helpfulness response, compared to
the weakly supervised model JST.

6.3 Aspect Detection

Figure 4: Correlation versus number of aspects on
Books reviews.
Figure 4 plots the results on the Books review data. Again,
SJASM results in better performance compared to sLDA,
JST, and LR. The average correlation score of SJASM across
all the observations is 28.13%, which is 5.79%, 9.59%, and
18.78% larger than that of sLDA, JST, and LR, respectively.
The proposed SJASM outperforms the state-of-the-art topic
models sLDA and JST, as well as one classic linear regression model for the overall review helpfulness prediction.

In this section, we qualitatively evaluated the aspect detection of SJASM against sLDA and JST on the Audio CD,
Video Game, and Books categories. For every category, we
showed one same aspect detected by each model, given the
aspect number K at which the minimum MSE was achieved
for that model.
Table 5 lists an example aspect “lyrics” on Audio CD reviews. Note for SJASM we showed the aspect terms and
opinion words semantically related to the aspect in column
1 and column 2 (first 5 opinion words are positive, the follow-

ing 5 are negative), respectively, since SJASM models separately both types of words in its unified framework. Both
sLDA and JST fail to do this, the aspect terms and opinion
words recognized for the aspect by the two models are mixed
together, as shown in column 3 and 4, respectively.
In particular, the aspect terms recognized for the aspect
“lyrics” by SJASM (column 1), such as “lyrics”, “views”,
“life”, “government”, “Bush”, etc., reflect the content of lyrics,
and the keywords are coherent as well as are indicative of
the aspect “lyrics”. The opinion words (column 2), such as
“lyrical”, “rebel”, and “conservative”, are also semantically
related to the “lyrics” aspect.
sLDA identifies some relevant keywords like “lyrics”, “Bush”,
“conservative”, etc., however, it also recognizes incorrectly
the keywords like “rock” and “metal” which are typically
mentioned in the aspect “genre”. The keywords recognized
for the aspect by JST contains non-specific terms like “CD”
and “masterpiece” which usually indicate the audio CD itself.
Table 6 lists a typical example aspect “gameplay” on Video
Games category. SJASM again detects a coherent “gameplay” aspect which covers the aspect terms, such as “map”,
“features”, and “gameplay”, as well as the semantically re-

lated opinion words, such as “graphic”, “played”, “realistic”,
and “bloody”. sLDA recognizes the semantically related
words like “missions”, “map”, and “features”, but mixes together the general terms like “nice” and “fine”. Similar to
sLDA, the aspect keywords clustered by JST are not as specific as that by SJASM.

Table 7 lists an example aspect “story” on Books reviews.
The aspect detected by SJASM is specific and coherent enough

“life”, “events”, “ending”, and “climax”, as well as the semantically related opinion words like “real”, “imaginative”,
“dark”, and “evil”, compared to the aspect detection results
by both sLDA and JST, which recognize some non-specific
words like “right”, “sense”, and “Book”.
The improvement of SJASM over sLDA and JST for underlying aspect detection is mainly attributed to:

All the models achieve 100% precision at top-1 selected
review for the aspect “story” on Books category. sLDA results in 40% and 60% precision at top-5 and top-10 selected
reviews, while JST leads to 60% and 50% precision, respectively. Overall, SJASM achieves the best performance with
100% and 80% precision at top-5 and top-10 selected useful
reviews for the aspect.

• The incorporation of review helpfulness voting information into the modeling framework enables SJASM
to exploit the supervision knowledge to guide the aspect inference process. But JST does not benefit from
such guidance for aspect detection.

• SJASM separates and simultaneously models the aspect terms and their corresponding opinion words in
individual opinion pairs to detect the underlying aspects, while both slDA and JST do not gain from this.

6.4 Aspect-based Review Utility Estimation
Further, we evaluated the aspect-based review utility estimation for three more aspects “character”, “plot”, and “writing” on Books category, as shown in Table 9. SJASM again
achieves the best performance (P @T op − N ) compared to
sLDA and JST.
The improved effectiveness of SJASM over sLDA and JST
for the aspect-based review utility estimation can be attributed to the following reasons:

The recommendation of the most useful reviews for each
detected product aspect is required to satisfy two conditions:
the review must be helpful, and the aspect must be relevant
to the helpful review.
For each aspect, the aspect-based review utility score was
estimated using Equation 11, which incorporates two criteria corresponding to the aforementioned requirements: the
predicted review helpfulness and document-specific aspect
distribution. We selected the most helpful and relevant reviews for each aspect in terms of the aspect-based review
utility scores.
We tested the aspect-based review utility estimation of
SJASM using precision at top N (P @T op − N ) selected reviews for each detected aspect, as shown in Table 8.

• SJASM leads to more coherent and clean aspect detection compared to sLDA and JST.
• SJASM outperforms the two benchmark models for
review helpfulness prediction on the review corpora.
• Benefitting from the supervised joint topic modeling
nature, SJASM discovers better the hidden topical structure of review data.

7. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we focus on selecting the most helpful reviews not only for a reviewed product itself but also for the
evaluated aspects of the product. We propose a novel supervised joint topic model called SJASM to address the coarseto-fine review selection problem. SJASM jointly discovers
underlying aspects and sentiments guided by review helpfulness voting information. One key advantage of SJASM
is that it can detect the sentimental aspects which are predictive of review helpfulness. The evaluation results on the
three publicly available review data sets demonstrated the
superiority of SJASM over a supervised topic model sLDA, a
weakly supervised model JST, as well as a classic LR model.
For future work, we plan to evaluate SJASM on other different product categories for coarse-to-fine review selection
problem.

For the aspect “lyrics” on Audio CD category, all evaluated
models achieved 100% precision at the top-1 selected review.
SJASM achieves 100% precision, while both sLDA and JST
have precision of 60% and 40%, respectively, at the top-5
recommended reviews. For the top-10 selected review for
the aspect, SJASM achieves 80% precision, while the two
baseline models sLDA and JST have only 50% precision.
That is, 8 out of top-10 reviews selected by SJASM are truly
useful for the aspect, while only 5 out of 10 reviews selected
by sLDA or JST are useful.
On the Video Games reviews, all models achieve 100%
precision at top-1 recommended review for the aspect “gameplay”. SJASM reaches 80% precision at top-5 and top-10 selected reviews, while sLDA has only 40% precision for both
cases. JST reaches 60% precision for its top-5 reviews, then
decreases to 40% precision at its top-10 selected reviews for
the aspect.
