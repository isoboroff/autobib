Since event extraction methods [6, 7] typically depend on term
frequency, it is possible to miss important information when
extracting events from Twitter. This is especially true if retweets
are not pertinent to an event, such as a rumor, spam or
advertisement, all of which are common in the SNS environment.
In order to reliably extract reliable low-frequency events as well
as high-frequency events, two types of reliable users should be
included in the event extraction method: the active user and the
socially well-known user. Active users are valuable users because
they post important information every time an event occurs. On
the other hand, if a socially well-known user mentions a particular
event, it indicates that a significant social event occurred. In
addition, the events themselves have important features. The day a
new event occurs, certain terms may be used more frequently that
day compared to other days. Users will also use Twitter to express
positive or negative opinions about particular issues or events.
Our model uses a sentiment lexicon to consider the context of an
event term which contains users’ opinions.

ABSTRACT
Social media such as Twitter has come to reflect the reaction of
the general public to major events. Since posts are short and noisy,
it is hard to extract reliable events based on word frequency. Even
though an event term appears in a particularly low frequency, as
long as at least one reliable user mentions the term, it should be
extracted. This paper proposes an event extraction method which
combines user reliability and timeline analysis. The Latent
Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model is adapted with the
weights of event terms on timeline and reliable users to extract
social events. The reliable users are detected on Twitter according
to their tweeting behaviors: socially well-known users and active
users. Reliable and low-frequency events can be detected based on
reliable users In order to see the effectiveness of the proposed
method, experiments are conducted on a Korean tweet collection;
the proposed model achieved 72% in precision. This shows that
the LDA with timeline and reliable users is effective for extracting
events on the Twitter test collection.

A number of studies have been conducted on various forms of
social media. Tinati et al. [8] developed a model based on Twitter
message exchanges which makes it possible to analyze
conversations about specific topics and identify key players in the
conversation. Sayyadi et al. [7] developed a new event detection
algorithm creating a keyword graph and using community
detection methods analogous to those used in social network
analysis in order to discover events.

The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model [1] provides a
principled way to discover hidden topics from large document
collections. However, standard topic models do not consider
temporal information. In the recent research on LDA, the topic
model [2] considers both the temporal information of microblog
posts and users’ personal interests.

1. INTRODUCTION
In recent years, media has become an important source of realtime information. People use social media to communicate,
socialize, debate and engage in arguments. With the rapidly
increasing amount of data on social networking service (SNS) like
Twitter, researches on event extraction are attracting more and
more attention. Compared with news and blog data, SNS data are
more widely used in real-time event extraction. However, as the
amount of data increases, noise also increases, creating a need for
a reliable event extraction method.

This paper proposes an event extraction model, which is a Latent
Dirichlet Allocation topic model based on timeline and user
behavior analysis. Timeline and user reliability analysis are
applied to the standard LDA model [1] to cover multiple events
occurring on the same day. A sudden increase in topically similar
posts usually indicates an event. Event terms are extracted using
the chi-square test and opinion scores to show how term
distribution is related to timeline and user sentiment about a
specific event. The reliable users are detected on Twitter
according to their tweeting behaviors: socially well-known users
and active users. The proposed model is novel in that it combines
user reliability and timeline analysis to extract event topics. To see
the effectiveness of the proposed model, experiments are
conducted on a Korean Twitter test collection. The paper is
organized as follows: Section 2 presents our event extraction
model; Section 3 describes experimental results. Finally, we
conclude in Section 4.

There are researches on effectively analyzing diversity of tweets
and inferring the occurrence and magnitude of an event [2, 3, 5].

where zi = j represents the assignments of the ith word in a
document to topic j. z-i represents all topic not including the ith
word. ChiOpScore is the additional weight of mth word in the
lexicon on time t. AuthScore denotes the additional weight of nth
user. The range of ChiOpScore and AuthScore are (0,1].
Furthermore,
is the number of times word m is assigned to
topic j, not including the current instance, and
is the number
of times user n is assigned to topic j, not including the current
instance. The proposed model is similar to the model proposed by
Diao et al. [2]. The primary difference between the two is that,
they assume a pair of posts published around the same time is
more likely to be about the same topic than a random pair of posts.
Here, term significance for a given day is measured by the chisquare statistic, which measures the lack of independence between
a term and the date. Another difference is that they compare a post
with its publisher’s general topical interests observed over time. If
a post does not match the user’s long-term interests, it is more
likely related to a global event. In this paper, reliable users are
concerned to extract an event. Then, if the reliable users post
about the issue on a particular day, it is more likely related to an
event. In addition, the model by Diao et al. extracts an event by
two Poisson distribution. The proposed method extracts social
events based on topic term clustering and reliable users based
filtering.

2. EVENT EXTRACTION MODEL
This section describes the overall structure of the proposed
method as shown in Figure 1. The method consists of a topic
discovery step and an event filtering step. In the topic discovery
step (section 2.1), a topic model is proposed that considers both
timeline (section 2.1.1) and user reliability (section 2.1.2). Event
filtering is performed with a similarity-based clustering and user
reliability-based filtering method (section 2.2).

2.1 Event Term Extraction Based on Timeline
and Reliable Users in LDA model
This section describes the event term extraction method based on
the LDA topic model with time and users. The purpose of using
the LDA model is to cover multiple events occurring on the same
day. This is in contrast to basic event extraction methods, which
are based on term frequency and therefore cannot extract multiple
events occurring on the same day. Timeline and user behavior
analysis are critical properties in the event extraction method.
When a new event occurs on a certain day, there is typically a
large occurrence of certain of certain terms on that day compared
to other days. In order to give distinctive weight to an event term,
term significance can be calculated based on timelines. In addition,
when an event occurs, generally public is informed about it by
authority users, or through mass media, or through normal users
on Twitter. Each time an event occurs there are some users who
tend to write profusely about the issue. Such users are concerned
about the issue for a long time and may publish valuable
information on that issue. Thus, it is important to detect accurate
and reliable users in order to extract accurate and reliable events.

2.1.1 Timeline Analysis
When a new event occurs on a certain day, there may be a high
occurrence of certain terms on that day compared to other days.
The term significance is measured by the Chi-square statistic,
which measures the lack of independence between a term and the
date. Users write tweets to express their opinions on particular
issues or events with positive or negative sentiment words. A
sentiment lexicon is used to detect the context of an event term
which contains the user’s opinion.
Event terms are extracted by combining the Chi-square value
(ChiSq) and opinion score (OpScore) to show how term
distribution is related to the timeline and user sentiments for a
specific event, as follows (see more details in [9]):

In the proposed model, the LDA model is adapted with timeline
and user reliability analysis to extract event topic groups (Figure
2). Here, T represents time series, U indicates user sets,
indicates the additional weight of each term on time t, and π
denotes the additional weight of each user. The topic distribution
of each user is drawn from a prior Dirichlet distribution Dir( ),
and each document word w is sampled from topic-word
distribution
specified by a drawn from the topic-user
distribution .

where w is a bigram word, t0 is a particular date, and λ is set to 0.7
empirically. OpScore is measured by combining the frequency of
a term and the frequency of opinion words. The ChiOpScore value
(additional time weight ) of each term is applied to the
TimeReliableUser LDA model to account for the impact of event
terms.

2.1.2 User Behavior Analysis
When an event occurs, generally the public is informed about it by
authority users, or through mass media, or through normal users
on Twitter. In addition, each time an event occurs there are some
users who tend to write profusely about the issue. Such users are
concerned about the issue for a long time and may publish
valuable information on that issue. For example, weather
information from the official Twitter account of the National
Weather Service is accurate and reliable. Similarly, it can be quick
and reliable to get the latest information about iPhones from the
official Twitter account of Apple. Thus, it is important to detect
accurate and reliable users in order to extract accurate and reliable
events. A critical part of the event extraction model is the
classification of Twitter users. In our model, users are categorized
as either socially well-known users or active users. If a socially

well-known user mentions a particular event, it indicates that an
important social event occurred. Highly active users, on the other
hand, post important information whenever a new event occurs.
Both of these groups are considered reliable users.

The five users with the highest activity score are selected as active
and reliable users. Both socially well-known users and active and
reliable users are classified as reliable users. These reliable users
are selected as input data π for the our LDA model.

2.1.2.1 Detecting socially well-known users

2.2 Event Filtering

Generally, socially well-known users on Twitter tend to have a
large number of tweets and retweets. A HITS algorithm [4] was
adapted to extract socially well-known users by applying
mentions, RTs (modified retweet), and retweets as an edge weight
between user nodes.

The results of the TimeReliableUser LDA model can include
similar topic groups and noisy, high-frequency event terms which
are not related to the event. Thus, the extracted events are filtered
by user data from reliable and highly active users. Ideally, this
process will give a lower rank to highly frequent but unrelated
event terms, and a higher rank to frequent but important event
terms. The system creates 20 topic groups for each day and each
topic group has 20 words and 20 users. Duplicate topic groups
were removed by applying the cosine similarity measure, which
measures the similarity between two vectors by finding the cosine
of the angle between them. The process is as follows:

The edge weight wqp is as follows:

Step 1: Compute similarity score between each topic-word group
Step 2: Compute similarity score between each topic-user group
Step 3: If the average similarity scores of each topic-word pair
and topic-user pair are greater than the threshold, then group them
together (single link clustering).
Step 4: Select a topic-word group as an event group if a topic-user
group includes reliable users.
The threshold of cosine similarity for clustering topic-word
groups was set at 0.5 based on results from the qualitative analysis
and analysis of the number of topic pairs. The event topic group
filtering process is shown in Figure 4.

The 5 users with the highest AuthScore values are considered
socially well-known users.

2.1.2.2 Detecting active users
These users generally post profusely about a given topic and
related events, and thus are typically more active than other users.
The following formula calculates the average weekly activity
score.

where W show the number of weeks; TweetFreq shows the sum of
tweets d that a user u wrote in the ith week; RTFreq represents the
number of retweets d of the tweets written by a user u in the ith
week.
The distribution of reliable user tweets about earthquakes and the
number of news articles about earthquakes on a given date are
shown in Figure 3. The number of tweets about an earthquake, the
tweet distribution of the top 5 reliable users, and the number of
news articles about the earthquake all have very similar patterns.
Peaks on the graph labeled by date represent the occurrence of
earthquakes. An increase in daily tweet frequency indicates that
all reliable users wrote about an issue on the same day.

Figure 4. Topic clustering and filtering process
In Figure 4, the first step provides several topics and each topic
group has an associated probability score. The number of topic
group sets is obtained after measuring cosine similarity between
the topic groups. Finally, the topic groups are filtered by reliable
users or author reliability score. Even if an event term has a
particularly low frequency of occurrence, as long as at least one
reliable user mentioned the term, it can be extracted.

The top 5 reliable and highly active users for the term “earthquake”
are shown in Figure 3. User 1(Korean Red Cross) wrote tweets
not only about the earthquake itself, but also about ways to donate
or help. In contrast, user 5 (Ministry of Foreign Affairs) posted
tweets that include guidelines for South Korean citizens who live
in abroad, while users 2 (KBS news) and 3 (journalist) provided
earthquake-related news.

The effectiveness of the proposed method of tweet collection was
evaluated as follows: Four topics were selected, and tweets related
to these topics or events were collected from November 1, 2010 to
March 26, 2011 by Twitter API (all tweets are written in Korean).
Table 1 shows the number of tweets related to each issue and 41
social events for the four issues. Each record in this tweet data set
contains the actual tweet body and the time when the tweet was
published.

top words and top users. Each topic is shown with five words and
users that have the highest probability conditioned on that topic.
As shown in Table 3, the first and second topic groups are event
groups because those groups include reliable users. Third topic
groups are also event groups, but the system could not retrieve
them. The reason is that groups are not including reliable users.
However similarity-based clustering gave us meaningful topic
groups and it reduced the topic groups depending on the event
type.

3.2 Experimental Results
Comparison methods for event extraction are as follows:

 Standard LDA: Original topic model [1]
 BurstTimeUser LDA: LDA with time and users to find

bursty topics [2]

4. CONCLUSION

This paper proposed an event extraction method based on a
timeline and user behavior analysis in LDA on Twitter. On the
TimeReliableUser LDA model, event candidate terms and reliable
users were reflected by term significance and user activity
measurements. Similar topics are clustered by measuring term
relevance and by considering reliable users. The proposed method
achieved 92% average precision in the top 10 results. The study
findings show that using the TimeReliableUser LDA model with
reliable users can increase the effectiveness of event extraction.

reliable users and timeline analysis
Two human assessors judged the answers for the result topics by
each method on the particular dates which an event occurred. The
ten dates in average are selected according to the number of news
articles on the issue. After preliminary experiments, the number of
topics was set at K to 20, α to 0.01 and β to 0.01, empirically. The
TimeReliableUser LDA was run for 500 iterations of Gibbs
sampling, with time T spanning from November 1, 2010 to March
26, 2011 for a total of 147 days.

Future research should focus on methods for better event
expression and less dependency on the number of tweets.

Table 2 shows experimental results on 41 events, with the number
of answers detected out of the total number of answers for each
event. Evaluation process is as follows. Each model gives 20 topic
groups on particular day. Here, the proposed model gives
clustered topic groups with reliable user groups. When the number
of tweets is less than other day, the proposed model gives two or
three topic groups. And when the numbers of tweets are high then
the model gives some topic groups which have similar user groups.
The baseline LDA model achieved 55%, BurstTimeUser LDA
achieved 63%, and the proposed model, TimeReliableUser LDA,
achieved 72% in macro average precision. Our model outperforms
other models in precision and recall. This shows that timeline and
reliable users played an effective role on event extraction.
