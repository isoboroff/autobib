ABSTRACT
In this study, we analyze an educational search engine log
for shedding light on K-12 students’ search behavior in a
learning environment. We specially focus on query, session,
user and click characteristics and compare the trends to the
findings in the literature for general web search engines. Our
analysis helps understanding how students search with the
purpose of learning in an educational vertical, and reveals
new directions to improve the search performance in the
education domain.

ish students at K-12 level. Turkey has the youngest population in Western Europe (by median age) and 42.9% of its
total population, which is estimated to be around 77 millions
as of December 2013, is young, i.e., younger than 24 years
old. According to national statistics, the number of students
at primary and secondary schools adds up to 16,156,519
(excluding pre-school and open-education students)1 . Not
surprisingly, there are several governmental and industrial
efforts to develop education services and products targeting this young and dynamic population. VitaminTM is a
commercial web-based educational framework that provides
interactive content and performance assessment mechanisms
for a large variety of courses covered in K-12 curriculum in
Turkey. As of December 2013, Vitamin has more than 1.2
million registered users and about 4.3 million site visits per
month. These users can utilize the navigational interface to
reach to the content they need, or they can perform search
over the entire set of educational materials (Figure 1).
Following the practice in [8], we provide the characteristics of search in Vitamin with respect to four major dimensions; namely, queries, sessions, users, and clicked results.
We also compare and contrast our findings to those on general web search engines and/or earlier results on children’s
search behaviors. Our analysis helps understanding how students search with the purpose of learning in an educational
vertical, and reveals new directions to improve the search
performance in the education domain.

INTRODUCTION

Search is a key web activity among all kinds of users towards a large variety of goals. While the lion’s share of previous works on query analysis focus on general web search, the
need for analyzing the search behavior of certain user groups
and/or users searching for a certain type of information has
emerged as an important research direction. Recent studies show that children and teenagers, who constitute a large
and dynamic subset of web users, deserve special attention
as their search behaviour differ from the adults in several
ways while using search engines [6, 3, 2]. Other studies address alternative search tasks that are usually carried out
via verticals, and analyze query logs obtained from the systems specialized for digital libraries, audio-visual archives
and earching people on the web [8].
In this paper, we analyze the query logs of a commercial
educational content developer and service provider for Turk-

stricted domain than web and even a couple of terms can
yield the relevant resources from the available content.
Table 2 lists top-10 most frequent queries, which yields
interesting findings. First, top-2 queries are “games” and
“game”, which means that the students enjoy the educational games provided by this system. Among the remaining 8 queries, 3 of them are simply the course names and
too general to be useful (i.e., “science”, “math”, “Turkish”).
This implies that the students who want to find a certain
course still use the search box, rather than browsing through
the list of courses. The other popular queries are related to
Turkish and Math courses, and might be related to the topics that are being discussed in these courses at this time of
the year.
As mentioned before, Vitamin’s search interface allows
setting various filters along with a query, which we analyze
next. Figure 3 shows the distribution of content type filters
selected while submitting queries. It is seen that all content
types are selected in the majority of the queries, which is the
default setting in the GUI. This means that users leave this
filter as-is most of the time, probably because they want to
see all available content relevant to their query. We observe
similar trends for the use of course filter, as shown in Figure 5. In contrast, the grade filter, at a first look, seems to
be used more effectively as the majority (more than 70%) of
the searches are restricted to a certain grade level (Figure 4);
grades 5, 6 and 7 being the most popular ones. However,
this difference in the behavior may not necessarily be caused
by the students’ awareness of this filter, as the search GUI
for the trial accounts, by default, shows only the user’s own
grade level as selected. Therefore, for most of the searches,
we can still claim that students are reluctant to change the
default filter settings, confirming the results in [4]. This is an
interesting finding that deserves further analysis, as it can
provide useful insight for designing a better search interface.

Vitamin search engine allows users to issue a keyword
query along with a number of category filters, namely, content type, grade, and course filters. Figure 1 shows the GUI
of the Vitamin’s search system for the query “carbon dioxide”. Then, users can click and display a particular query
result, which is called a learning object and presented in text
and/or audio-visual formats; or navigate to certain point in
a topic hierarchy where this learning object belongs to. The
system stores the queries and clicked results in the search
log, while the navigational type of interaction is recorded
separately as a different kind of event. Therefore, our preliminary analysis here involves a query log that includes a
sample from the queries submitted to Vitamin’s search system in December 2013 by the logged-in users (i.e., with paying or trial accounts), and followed by at least one click on
the displayed results.
Query characteristics. According to Table 1, 27.8% of
the query volume are unique queries and 69.3% of the latter
are singletons, i.e., asked only once. These values differ from
the web search trends, where 50% of the queries in a typical
search log are unique and 88% of them are singletons [1];
and more similar to the trends obtained for a vertical for
searching people [8]. This means that the queries are more
likely to be repeated in this educational search engine, which
is a good news for the mechanisms that exploit temporal
locality, such as caching. On the other hand, distribution of
query frequencies shown in Figure 2 (left plot) confirms the
power law distribution characteristics as in the case of web
search [1].

On the average, a query includes 2.16 terms, which is
slightly shorter than typical web queries (around 2.5 terms
as reported in [1]) as well as the queries submitted to a major
web search engine by the users between 10 and 18 years old
(around 2.6 terms [6]). This difference might be attributed
to the fact that the educational search setup is a more re-

Session characteristics. As in the previous studies [6],
we detect sessions by grouping together a particular user’s
successive searches that has a time gap less than a time-out
value (30 minutes). Table 3 presents several statistics about
query sessions. Among the total of 35K sessions, about 59%
include only one query. This skewed distribution of session length in number of queries can be seen in Figure 2
(right). Users submit around two queries in a session on
average (computed by macro-averaging over users). The average number of queries submitted to a commercial search
engine is 2.4 [7]. The average session duration in our log
is 4.7 minutes and this is slightly longer than the session
duration for children (between ages 6-18) reported in [6].
However when it is compared to a general user’s query session in a web search engine (around 7 minutes in [7]), it is
shorter. This again indicates that the students can effectively find what they look for in this context of educational
search.
User characteristics. We present the characteristics of
users in Table 4. Among 18K total users, 40% of them issue
only one query during the one month period of our log. This
skewed distribution can also be seen in Figure 6 (left plot),
where a large portion of users asks very few queries but a
few users submit large number of queries. The distribution
of the number of sessions over users shown in Figure 6 (right
plot) is even more skewed since 60% of users interact in only
one session. On the average, users ask 3.61 queries in 1.92
sessions.
Figure 7 shows the distribution of query submissions over
time. Monthly analysis (left plot) shows weekly patterns
clearly. Students submit the largest number of queries on
Sunday and least number of queries on Friday, according to
the daily analysis in Figure 7 (center). This provides some
interesting clues in students’ studying habits: the students
heavily search for information on Sunday, while they might
be doing the homeworks for the upcoming week. Then, their
activity in the search engine decreases gradually in the weekdays and reach the minimum on Friday, when most of the
students seem to enjoy the weekend. Hourly analysis in Fig-

ure 7 (right) shows the percentage of queries submitted to
the system in different hours of a day separately for weekdays and weekends. It is seen that students prefer to use
the system mostly between 18:00-21:00 on weekdays (after
school) and between 12:00-21:00 on weekends.

and per session (right).
Result-click characteristics. In this part, we analyze
the clicks on the query results. We find a total of 155,537
clicks in our log and, on the average, users click 2.56 results
per query and 5.33 results per session. The log-log scale
plots in Figure 8 shows that the distribution of number of
clicks is again skewed and for the majority of the queries
(and sessions), only one result object is clicked.
Figure 9 (left) shows the percentage of clicks for each type
of learning objects. It is seen that users mostly prefer “animation” and “interactive exercise” type of contents. Furthermore, “interactive activity” and “lecture” type of contents are
also clicked frequently, while textual resources (“Text”) are
less likely to be clicked. These findings reflect the students
preference of interactive content over purely textual material, which actually leads most educational content to be
presented in the former format in Vitamin.
Finally, we focus on the ranks of the clicked results in
Figure 9 (right). We see that while top-2 results, nonsurprisingly, take the largest share of the clicks, there is

haviors. In particular, the high fraction of repeated queries
indicates that system components that rely on the query
history (such as caching and query suggestion) can be made
more effective. The students’ preferences in using the query
filters call for reconsidering the design of the search interface. Finally, our result-click analysis shows that students
prefer active content formats (like animations and interactive lectures) over the static content (like text) and can click
further lower ranks in the results list other than the first few
results. Such findings can help designing better features for
the machine-learned ranking algorithms and lead higher user
satisfaction, which is our future research direction.

a non-negligible fraction of clicks for the results placed at
much lower ranks, even after rank 20. According to a general web search engine log [5], clicks for top-2 results account
for 58% of all clicks and only 9% of clicks are below rank
10. However, in our log, top-2 clicks and clicks after rank
10 constitute 36% and 20% of all clicks, respectively. This
might either indicate the students’ dissatisfaction of the results, or their preference to see several relevant results while
learning a topic. In our future work, we plan to conduct
user studies to gain more insights into students’ search behaviour. Furthermore, the existence of clicks at lower ranks
indicates that there might be room for improving the ranking algorithm, which is another future work direction.
