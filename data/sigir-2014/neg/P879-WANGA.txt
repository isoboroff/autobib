ABSTRACT

targets at a small set of inﬂuential individuals (nodes) in the
network. Thus, the key problem is how to ﬁgure out these
inﬂuential nodes. To this end, Kempe et al. [9] formulate it
as a discrete optimization problem known as inﬂuence maximization problem. In their paper, two classical propagation
models were discussed: Linear Threshold (LT) model [7]
and Independent Cascade(IC) model [5]. Furthermore, they
proved that inﬂuence maximization is an NP-hard problem
in both models and proposed a greedy solution. Due to the
submodular property of this problem, the greedy algorithm
can approximate the optimal solution within a constant factor. Meanwhile, Monte Carlo simulation is used to estimate
the inﬂuence spread (i.e., the expected number of nodes that
will be inﬂuenced) of the node set in the greedy algorithm,
as inﬂuence propagation is treated as a stochastic process in
both LT and IC models.
One of the biggest challenges of the greedy algorithm
is that we need to run Monte Carlo simulation suﬃciently many times (e.g., 10,000) for accurately estimating the
inﬂuence spread, i.e., very time-consuming. Thus, the following researchers mainly focus on reducing the calculation.
Leskovec et al. [11] exploited the submodular property and
proposed CELF algorithm which is 700 times faster than the
greedy algorithm without eﬀectiveness loss. Chen et al. [3]
proposed degree discount heuristic algorithm which is much
faster than the greedy algorithm but not as eﬀective as it.
Along this line, several other heuristic algorithms have been
proposed [2, 4, 6, 15]. These algorithms exploit the property
of the social network or approximate the inﬂuence propagation models for computing the inﬂuence spread of a set of
nodes faster [1]. In this way, they speed up the algorithm
but are usually less eﬀective.
However, we can explore other aspects of the inﬂuence
maximization problem besides searching for more eﬀective
heuristics. That is, we may think about this problem from a
diﬀerent perspective. Actually, inﬂuence maximization ﬁnds
some inﬂuential nodes whose inﬂuence can cover the whole
network, which is similar to selecting some informative rows
to reconstruct a matrix. Inspired by [16, 8], in this paper we
treat inﬂuence maximization as a data reconstruction problem. Speciﬁcally, we propose a novel framework called Data Reconstruction for Influence Maximization(DRIM) which
ﬁnds the inﬂuential nodes by minimizing the reconstruction
error. In our framework, we ﬁrst construct an inﬂuence matrix, each row of which is the inﬂuence of a node to other
nodes. Then, we try to select k most informative rows to
reconstruct the inﬂuence matrix and the corresponding nodes are the seed nodes which could maximize the inﬂuence

Inﬂuence maximization is the problem of ﬁnding a set of
seed nodes in social network for maximizing the spread of
inﬂuence. Traditionally, researchers view inﬂuence propagation as a stochastic process and formulate the inﬂuence
maximization problem as a discrete optimization problem.
Thus, most previous works focus on ﬁnding eﬃcient and
eﬀective heuristic algorithms within the greedy framework.
In this paper, we view the inﬂuence maximization problem
from the perspective of data reconstruction and propose a
novel framework named Data Reconstruction for Influence
Maximization(DRIM). In our framework, we ﬁrst construct
an inﬂuence matrix, each row of which is the inﬂuence of a node to other nodes. Then, we select k most informative rows
to reconstruct the matrix and the corresponding nodes are
the seed nodes which could maximize the inﬂuence spread.
Finally, we evaluate our framework on two real-world data
sets, and the results show that DRIM is at least as eﬀective
as the traditional greedy algorithm.

as eﬀective as the greedy algorithm. Our contributions can
be summarized as follows:

matrix is the inﬂuence of a node to other nodes, ﬁnding
informative rows to reconstruct the inﬂuence matrix essentially means ﬁnding inﬂuential nodes whose inﬂuence can
cover the whole network. Speciﬁcally, we try to select k
most informative rows to reconstruct the inﬂuence matrix
and the corresponding nodes are the seed nodes. Inspired
by [16, 8], we formulate this problem as follows:

• We view the inﬂuence maximization problem from the
perspective of data reconstruction and propose a novel
framework named DRIM to solve it.
• We evaluate the proposed framework on two real-world
data sets. Experimental results show that DRIM is at
least as eﬀective as the traditional greedy algorithm.

In this section, we propose a new framework to solve the
inﬂuence maximization problem from the perspective of data reconstruction. We ﬁrst review the deﬁnition of inﬂuence maximization problem, and then describe the proposed
framework in detail.
Let G = (V, E, T ) represent a social network, where V
is the node set and E is the edge set. If there is an edge
from node i to node j in E, ti,j in inﬂuence propagation
matrix T = [ti,j ]n∗n is the inﬂuence transmission probability
from i to j. According to the deﬁnition of Kempe et al. [9],
inﬂuence maximization problem is a discrete optimization
problem: given a social network, and a number k, ﬁnd k
nodes, called the seed set, such that by activating them,
the expected number of ﬁnal activated nodes is maximized.
Diﬀerent from traditional methods, we ﬁnd the inﬂuential
seed nodes from the perspective of data reconstruction. The
proposed framework contains two steps:
1. Construct an inﬂuence matrix X ∈ RN ×N , where xi ∈
R1×N indicates the inﬂuence of node i.
2. Select k most informative rows from the matrix X to
reconstruct it, and we can ﬁnd the inﬂuential seed nodes simultaneously.

where AT = [a1 , ...an ]. β = [β1 , ..., βn ]T is an auxiliary
variable to control nodes selection. We impose l1 norm [13]
on β to induce sparsity. If βj = 0, the j-th column must be
0 which means the j-th node is not selected.
We’d like to give more implication about the nonnegative
constraints [10] used in Eq. (1). Since one’s inﬂuence will
not fade with the existence of others, which shares a similar
assumption with IC model, the nonnegative constraints used
here can make the result more interpretable. That is, it
allows only additive, not subtractive, combination of the
nodes’ inﬂuence vectors.
By ﬁxing ai ’s and setting the derivative of J with respect
to β to be zero, we can obtain the closed-form solution of
β:

By ﬁxing β, the remaining problem can be solved by projected gradient descent. The gradient is :

Thus the update formula is:

2.1 Constructing Influence Matrix
There are a few ways to construct the inﬂuence matrix.
However, in IC and LT model, we have to use Monte Carlo
simulation to estimate the inﬂuence spread which is very
time-consuming. Thus we turn to the linear model proposed
by Xiang et al. [14]. In their model, we can get a closed-form
solution of the inﬂuence of a single node or a set of nodes.
Speciﬁcally, the inﬂuence from i to j, fi→j , is deﬁned as :

ai = max(0, ai − C

where Nj = {j1 , j2 , ...jm } is j’s neighborhood node set, αj

According to the solution given by Xiang et al. [14], we
can obtain the inﬂuence vector fi = [fi→1 , fi→2 , ...fi→n ]′ of
node i by solving the linear system P −1 P·i = ei , where
P = (I + λI − T ′ )−1 . And fi is exactly the i-th row of the
inﬂuence matrix X.

2.2 Finding Influential Nodes

We provide validation on two real-world data sets. One of
them is the Wikipedia who-votes-on-whom network (WikiVote), and the other one is the collaboration network from
DBLP. Speciﬁcally, we demonstrate that our framework is
at least as eﬀective as the greedy algorithm.

Given inﬂuence matrix, we can ﬁnd inﬂuential nodes with
data reconstruction method. Since each row of the inﬂuence

Eﬀectiveness validation. We run tests on four social
networks to obtain inﬂuence spread results. The seed set
size k ranges from 1 to 100, and the parameter γ is 0.4.
Figure 1 shows the inﬂuence spread results on the four social
networks. The inﬂuence spread results in Figure 1 show
that DRIM and Greedy obviously outperform the Degree
Discount and PageRank. DRIM and Greedy have a
similar eﬀectiveness when the seed size k is small. However,
when k increases, DRIM has a bit better performance than
Greedy. We can discover such a tendency in all four social
networks. Actually, Table 2 compares the inﬂuence spread
results of DRIM and Greedy when k is greater than 80.
In Table 2, we use “+” and “-” to denote the wins and losses
of DRIM compared with Greedy respectively. When we
pay attention to the nodes these algorithms ﬁnd, we discover
another interesting phenomenon: DRIM and Greedy ﬁnd
the same top 10 inﬂuential nodes on Wiki-Vote data set. As
for other social networks, most of the inﬂuential nodes that
DRIM and Greedy ﬁnd are the same, when k increases
from 10 to 100. Finally, Table 3 shows the high number of
the same inﬂuential nodes found by DRIM and Greedy.
This phenomenon demonstrates the eﬀectiveness of DRIM
from another angle.
Case Study. We show a case study by illustrating the
names of inﬂuential seed nodes (k=10) in DM domain in Table 4. From Table 4, we can see that the inﬂuential authors
found by DRIM and Greedy are quite similar. Because
of the lack of ground truth, we refer to top authors list in
DM domain provided by Microsoft Academic Search6 . This
list ranks the authors in DM domain according to their ﬁeld
rating. The ﬁrst four authors found by DRIM is exactly
the top-4 authors in the list of Microsoft Academic Search.
However, the ﬁfth and seventh authors found by DRIM are
ranked 147 and 466 in the list of Microsoft Academic Search.
The remaining four authors are ranked top-100 in the list of
Microsoft Academic Search. The inﬂuential authors found
by Greedy have a similar phenomenon. The results show
that neither DRIM nor Greedy simply ranks the inﬂuence
of a single author. In fact, both algorithms select inﬂuential
nodes that could maximize the inﬂuence spread.

3.1 Experimental Setup
Data Sets. The ﬁrst data set is downloaded from SNAP4 . The second data set is downloaded from DBLP5 . As
for the second data set from DBLP, we focus on three research domains (i.e., three subnetworks), which are “Information Retrieval”(IR), “Data Mining”(DM) and “Machine
Learning”(ML). We select the papers that are published before January 2013 from several top-ranked journals and conferences for each domain. The authors of these papers are
used as nodes in the collaboration network. When two authors have one co-authored paper, an edge will be added
between the corresponding nodes.
The propagation probability of an edge (i, j) is set to
weight(i,j)
, as widely used in the literature [9, 3, 6, 15]. In
indegree(j)
order to make the linear system in Section 2.1 converge, we
slightly change the probability by multiplying it with a small
real number. For the propagation probability in real world
is quite small, we set it as 0.1 in our experiment.
In total, we get four social networks. More detailed information is shown in Table 1.
Parameter Settings. There are two parameters: α and
λ in linear model. When we compute the inﬂuence matrix,
we set the same α value for all nodes. Here, we set the α to
1, which means that each node has full conﬁdence of itself
and the self-inﬂuence is 1. As for λ, we choose the same
value as [14], which is 0.176. In the data reconstruction
step, there is a parameter γ that controls the sparsity of
the matrix. We have tried a few values in our experiment
and discovered that the algorithm gets its best performance
when γ equals to 0.4.
Baseline Algorithms. We compare the proposed framework, referred as DRIM, with three baseline algorithms on
the IC model. The baseline algorithms are as follows:
• Greedy: The greedy algorithm is proposed by Kempe
et al. [9]. For each candidate seed set S, we run 10,000
times simulations to obtain the inﬂuence spread of S.

• Degree Discount: Degree Discount algorithm is a
heuristic algorithm proposed by Chen et al. [3]. We
set parameter p of this algorithm to 0.01, the same
value used in [3].
• PageRank: PageRank [12] is often used in network
structure and social inﬂuence analysis, e.g., Chen et
al. [2] also used it as a baseline algorithm in their paper. We run PageRank (with damping factor d = 0.85)
in the network, and use the top k nodes as the inﬂuential seeds.

4. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper, we proposed a novel framework to solve
inﬂuence maximization problem from the perspective of data
reconstruction. The proposed framework ﬁrst constructs the
inﬂuence matrix, and then ﬁnds the inﬂuential seed nodes
with data reconstruction method. The experimental results
show that the proposed framework is at least as eﬀective
as the traditional greedy algorithm and outperforms other
heuristic algorithms.

Given the output of each algorithm, we use it as the initial
seeds to compute their inﬂuence spread on the IC model. In
the computation process, we run 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations to obtain an estimation of the inﬂuence spread.

There are several future directions related to this work.
First, we will parallelize Algorithm 1 to speed up the proposed framework. Second, we try to preprocess the network
with clustering method to reduce the size of the inﬂuence
matrix. Third, we believe that the idea used to solve the inﬂuence maximization problem can be applied to solve other
similar discrete optimization problems. Thus we’ll extend
our framework to solve other similar problems.
