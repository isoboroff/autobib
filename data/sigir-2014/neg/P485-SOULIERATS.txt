ABSTRACT

1.

Most of the previous approaches surrounding collaborative
information retrieval (CIR) provide either a user-based mediation, in which the system only supports users’ collaborative activities, or a system-based mediation, in which
the system plays an active part in balancing user roles, reranking results, and distributing them to optimize overall
retrieval performance. In this paper, we propose to combine both of these approaches by a role mining methodology
that learns from users’ actions about the retrieval strategy
they adapt. This hybrid method aims at showing how users
are di↵erent and how to use these di↵erences for suggesting
roles. The core of the method is expressed as an algorithm
that (1) monitors users’ actions in a CIR setting; (2) discovers di↵erences among the collaborators along certain dimensions; and (3) suggests appropriate roles to make the most
out of individual skills and optimize IR performance. Our
approach is empirically evaluated and relies on two di↵erent
laboratory studies involving 70 pairs of users. Our experiments show promising results that highlight how role mining could optimize the collaboration within a search session.
The contributions of this work include a new algorithm for
mining user roles in collaborative IR, an evaluation methodology, and a new approach to improve IR performance with
the operationalization of user-driven system-mediated collaboration.

In an information retrieval (IR) process, there are several ways to improve retrieval performance or e↵ectiveness.
Some approaches, such as pseudo-relevance feedback [13]
and query expansion [30] focus on improving IR systems
and algorithms. Others try to improve users’ experience
by o↵ering related queries [2] or making personalized recommendations [29]. In the end, the e↵ectiveness of an IR
setting has to do with user’s preferences and/or skills just
as much as it has with system performance. One way that
e↵ectiveness could be improved that is often overlooked is
through collaboration. The approaches described above are
based on an individual searching, retrieving, and evaluating
information. But what if multiple people get involved in
these processes? Beyond simply dividing up the work, there
could be other potential benefits of multiple people working
together on a search-focused project. Specifically, if these
people bring in a variety of skills, then we have an opportunity to achieve synergic e↵ects [22]. The question is how
do we know who has which skills and how do we leverage
them. We could let the users decide it and let the system
be simply a supporting structure. This is often referred to
as user-mediated collaborative information retrieval (CIR)
[15, 23]. The other option is to have the system explicitly
assign prior roles and optimizing retrieval-related processes
accordingly. This is often referred to as a system or an
algorithmically-mediated CIR [20, 24].
Both of these lines of work have their merits and limitations. In this paper, we propose an approach that attempts
to combine the best of both of these techniques. Specifically, instead of imposing the roles onto the users (systemmediated) or having the users explicitly come up with their
roles (user-mediated), we propose to mine roles of collaborators implied within a collaborative search session. We refer
to this as user-driven system-mediated CIR. More particularly, the contributions of this paper are twofold:

RELATED WORK

Role Mining

Several research studies [21, 1, 5, 28] highlighted the
value of roles as means of control in collaborative applications. Role is viewed as a tool for better understanding users’ actions and interactions by putting them in context. For instance, Rodden [21] identified the value of control in computer-supported cooperative work systems and
listed a number of underlying projects with their corresponding schemes for implementing control. Golder and Donath
[5] considered Usenet environment for analyzing newsgroup
communities. They proposed a role taxonomy involving two
roles which they posit, namely “Celebrities” and “Ranters”,
and three well-know roles, namely “Lurkers”, “Trolls” and
“Newbies”. They also highlighted the underlying strategies
of each role and relationships between roles. Role-based control gives rise to a challenging research question: how can we
mine dynamically latent roles from user-group actions and
interactions in a collaborative setting?
Two main approaches for role mining are proposed in the
literature. The first one, rising from the social network
perspective, relies on the analysis of the topology properties of users’ network through information interaction [18,
12, 19, 7]. Nowicki and Snijders [18] presented a blockstructure mining method based on pair-wise graph relations
using Gibbs sampling. In [12], authors identified microblog
networks leaders by applying PageRank algorithm on the
followers network while Pal et al. [19] proposed to apply a
probabilistic clustering method that uses a set of features
from microblogging practices. Henderson et al. [7] provided
an unsupervised learning approach for role mining relying on
the transformation of feature-based multi-dimensional matrix where nodes represent users and edges represent information stream. The underlying objective is to select the
better compression model that summarizes the users’ behavior leading to roles. Di↵erent from the first approach, the
second one discovers user’s roles by looking at the similarities vs. dissimilarities between interaction data distributions
among users [14]. Authors proposed, first, the LDA-based
Author-Recipient-Topic (ART) model which is a global role
mining approach applied in a communication social network
for highlighting emerging roles through users’ behavior similarities. Second, they proposed a pair-wise focused version
of the ART by introducing the Role-Author-Recipient-Topic
(RART) model which emphasizes roles of the author and the
recipient according to the message-contents, assuming that
these roles could be fixed or could evolve throughout the
message writing process.
Based on relevant literature, we can see that di↵erent
forms of roles have been introduced within a collaborative
context, leveraging users’ skills and experiences in order to
enhance the collaboration. However, while some research
studies focused on mining latent roles from users’ interactions, previously proposed system-mediated collaborative
ranking models assign explicitly predefined roles to users regardless of the skills in which they are the most e↵ective.
In the work reported here, we attempt to combine insights
from the above works to bridge between system-mediated

User-based Mediation and System-based
Mediation for CIR

A collaborative search setting involves multiple users aiming at collaboratively solving a shared information need [4,
6, 25]. In [25] authors showed how collaborative search could
act as a front-end for existing search engines and re-rank results based on the learned preferences of a community of
users. They attempted to demonstrate this concept by implementing the I-Spy system [4]. However, this is often ine↵ective or non-trivial. For instance, Hyldegard [8], with
her studies of information seeking and retrieval in a groupbased education setting, found that even though people in
a collaborative group to some extent demonstrated similar
cognitive experiences as the individuals in Kuhlthau’s Information Search Process (ISP) model [11], these experiences
did not only result from information seeking activities, but
also from work-task activities and intra-group interactions.
Her further work also indicated [9] that group based problem solving is a dynamic process that shifts between a group
perspective and an individual perspective.
Complexity in CIR appears mainly from the fact that
collaboration is characterized by four main dimensions [6]:
(1) the intent, depending on if collaboration is implicit or
explicit, (2) the level of mediation, relying on how much
the system is active, (3) the concurrency, analyzing if the
search session is synchronous or not, (4) the location, describing a session involving remote or co-located users. Rising challenges in CIR [10] underline the practical necessity
of building interfaces adapted to collaboration and from an
IR perspective, leveraging IR techniques and models for supporting collaboration. To tackle these challenges, two main
lines of work can be distinguished: user-based mediation and
system-based mediation.
Previous user-based mediation work have proposed collaborative interfaces [16, 23] supporting collaboration within a
search process by using devices, such as interactive tables
[16], or tools, such as shared workspaces [23]. The second
category of work, referred to a system-oriented mediation,
relies on the incorporation of symmetric user’s roles [3, 17]
or asymmetric ones within the IR process [20, 24, 26] with
the aim of enhancing the collaboration and by the way, the
overall IR performance.
In [6], authors proposed a role taxonomy where several
sets of roles have been introduced: (1) symmetric (peers)
[6] in which users are considered as having symmetric roles;
(2) domain A expert and domain B expert [6, 26] in which
users are characterized as experts of di↵erent domains; (3)
search expert and search novice, respectively domain expert and domain novice [6, 27] in which users have di↵erent
familiarity levels towards a domain, or search tools; search
expert and domain expert [6] in which one user has access to
more functions and features with search tools, whereas the
other one is more familiar with the domain knowledge; (4)
Prospector and Miner [6, 20] in which Prospector’s task is

To achieve this, Sut is represented as a matrix Su 2 Rt⇥n
(t)
where each element Su (tl , fk ) represents the cumulative
value of feature fk for user u aggregated across the search
session during the time interval [t0 . . . tl ]. This aggregation
highlights the overall behavior of the user at timestamp tl
since looking at feature values at a particular timestamp may
not be enough considering that individual behaviors are constantly changing. Moreover, it avoids the bias induced by
noisy search actions.

and user-mediated collaboration and show how to leverage
specific latent roles of collaborators from users’ actions while
relaxing the assumption behind pre-assigned roles. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt for mining
users’ roles within a collaborative search, which enables implicitly and dynamically assigning roles to users in which
they can be most e↵ective at the current search stage.

RESEARCH DESIGN

3.1

Research Questions

In this work presented here, we do not assign any roles
to users in the beginning of the session. Users’ roles are
emphasized by users’ actions and are mined throughout the
synchronous collaborative search session. Keeping this in
mind, we address in this work the following research questions:
RQ1. If the searchers working in collaboration are di↵erent
in some aspects, how are they di↵erent?
RQ2. How do we infer users’ roles by taking into account
their actions within a collaborative search session?
RQ3. How can we use role information to improve CIR and
IR processes in general?

3.2

Roles.
A pair R1,2 of roles (r1 , r2 ) involves a couple of users
(u1 , u2 ) assumed to have di↵erent specific search features.
We introduce a role pattern P R1,2 2 P , where P is the
role pattern pool, as a set of two elements:
• A feature-based matrix F R1,2 2 RF ⇥F , which represents the underlined behaviors of users of the collaborative group if they are performing these roles.
Each element F R1,2 (fj , fk ) highlights the expected relation such as positive correlation (+1), negative correlation (-1) or independence (0) between the users’
behavior features fj , fk belonging to the pair of roles
under consideration. Here, we assume that a pair of
roles may be mined from a collaborative search session only if users’ behaviors are di↵erent and opposite. For instance, the Gatherer and Surveyor roles [24]
are di↵erentiated considering the fact that the Gatherer seeks highly relevant documents and thus formulates queries with a higher overlap than the Surveyor
whereas the Surveyor spends less time on Webpages
favoring the exploration of the information space, and
accordingly the average value of query success is lower,
than the Gatherer. Simply having behavior di↵erences for these two features is not enough because
what if the same person is better at both? Therefore, a negative correlation between these behaviors
is considered to ensure that both the behaviors are
found di↵erently in both the users. Accordingly, we
can define the related pair of roles through: (1) negative correlation between the query word overlap and
spent time on Webpages features, (2) negative correlation between query word overlap and query success
features. Thus, we define the pattern kernel K as the
set of feature pairs highlighted as negatively correlated
where KR1,2 = {(fj , fk ); F R1,2 (fj , fk ) = 1}.

Mining Users’ Roles

We initially consider a user-driven search setting in which
a set of users are working to meet a shared information need
by identifying relevant documents.
The goal of our approach is to analyze how users are different, and, accordingly suggest roles given their di↵erences
in order to optimize their collaborative outcome. In this
way, the search session can be viewed as a sequence of two
steps: (1) a user-driven level in which we assume that people start out with the same roles and responsibilities, but
then over time, they may exhibit di↵erences and affine their
search behavior; and (2) a system-mediated level in which
predefined roles have been identified, and the system optimizes the collaborative search process. In what follows, we
first define preliminary notions, and, then describe our role
mining methodology. Note that in order to simplify our explanation and economize our experiments, we will consider
only two participants in a collaborative search process.

3.2.1

Preliminaries

Let us consider a typical scenario of collaborative IR where
a pair of users (u1 , u2 ) collaborate during a time interval T
in order to answer a shared information need I. Each user
acts separately through the synchronous collaborative search
session S by formulating his own queries belonging to the
shared information need I. For clarity, we introduce the
following notions and notations:

(t)

(t)

• A role attribution function Role(Su1 , Su2 , R1,2 ), which
assigns each role of the pair R1,2 to users u1 and u2 ,
(t)
according to his/her intrinsic search behaviors Su1 and
(t)
Su2 respectively. For this purpose, we compare values
(t)
(t)
Su1 (tl , fk ) and Su2 (tl , fk ) of at least one search feature
fk of both collaborators u1 and u2 for identifying which
role of the pair R1,2 is the most likely suitable for each
user. For instance, in the case of Gatherer-Surveyor
roles, the query overlap feature should be higher for
the Gatherer. The output of this document attribution
function is a tuple of ordered roles (r, r 0 ) where the first
element is the role assigned to user u1 , and the second
element is the role assigned to user u2 . We define the
(t)
(t)
role attribution function Role(Su1 , Su2 , R1,2 ) as next.

User’s search session.

The user search session Sut of user u consists of all previous
queries qu1 , qu2 , . . . , qut 1 ordered by time, up to timestamp
t (0 < t < T ), and their corresponding documents results
sets Du1 , Du2 ,. . . , Dut 1 . Since the most important factor affecting the role mining task is naturally how much the users
are di↵erent while searching for information during the CIR
process, we favor a feature-based representation of the user’s
search session. Our goal is to characterize the user through
his past implicit actions’ features F = {f1 , . . . , fk , . . . , fn }

Finally, our objective is to mine at each timestamp t the
role pattern P R1,2 that likely maps the users’ past actions

represented through the users’ search sessions Su1 and Su2 ,
and accordingly to assign detected roles to collaborators.

3.2.2

Methodology

We now introduce our methodology to mine the pair of
users’ roles involved in a synchronous collaborative search
session. At each regular timestamp tl , a role mining method,
illustrated in Algorithm 1, is launched and runs in two main
stages, as described in what follows.

where ✓ is a significance level.
Afterwards, the role pattern is detected in the case that:

• The involved search features highlighted by a negative correlation within the role pattern are significantly di↵erent and negatively correlated between both
users. Indeed, we assume that users might behave
significantly di↵erently at least for features involved
within the role pattern. This condition can be formulated by the fact that if a feature correlation measure F R1,2 (fj , fk ) connected to the role pattern P r1 ,r2
(t )
equals to 1, then the correlation Cu1l,u2 (fj , fk )) underlying the users’ search behaviors between features
fj and fk should strictly be lower than 0.

These correlation computations rest on the condition that
the significance of both implied search feature di↵erences between both users is highlighted by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
statistical test; otherwise we set the correlation value to 0.

tifies their di↵erence. For this aim we attempt to detect
candidate role patterns through user’s search actions. The
method we adopted consists of computing the correlation between the user’s search features. More specifically, we consider features by pairs and analyze the correlation of users’
di↵erences towards the considered pairs of features.
Computing the correlation between the feature di↵erences
values rather than the feature values themselves avoids prior
assignment of any role to each user. Thus, we compute the
(t )
(t )
correlation between the vectors u1l,u2 (fj ) and u1l,u2 (fk )
(t )
with (fj , fk ) 2 F ⇥F . We build a di↵erence matrix u1l,u2 2
(t
)
Rtl ⇥F of each feature fk where each element u1l,u2 (tl , fk )
is defined as the di↵erence of the value of user u1 and user
u2 towards the search feature fk at timestamp tl :

• The role pattern correlation matrix is the most likely
similar to the collaborative group correlation matrix.
We are aware that an exact matching between correlation matrices respectively relying on role pattern and
users’ search behaviors is difficult to reach since the
role pattern is characterized by negative correlations
equal to - 1. Therefore, a reasonable role-based identification is to assign the role pattern correlation matrix
(t )
F R1,2 which is the most similar to the one Cu1l,u2 obtained for the pair of users (u1 , u2 ) at timestamp tl .

1. Identifying users’ search behavior di↵erences. Keeping
in mind that a pair of users’ roles implies di↵erent users’
search actions, the first stage consists of capturing significant di↵erences between the users’ search actions through
the analysis of their search sessions. More formally, in
order to identify the level of di↵erence between both users
u1 and u2 with respect to each feature fk 2 F , we use the
non-parametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical test, noted
(t )
ks.test() in Algorithm 1, between vectors Su1l (fk ) and
(tl )
Su2 (fk ). The obtained p-value for the statistical test is
(t )
noted as pu1l,u2 (fk ). Significant di↵erences imply that users
u1 and u2 have di↵erent search skills or strategies and thus
could play di↵erent roles in the search session.

More formally, a pair R1,2 of roles (r1 , r2 ) is assigned to a
pair of user (u1 , u2 ) at timestamp tl if it satisfies the following conditions:
argmin R1,2 ||F R1,2
subject to :

is to characterize the di↵erence between the users’ search
strategies in contrast to the previous stage that only iden-

EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

Experimental evaluation is based on two collaborative IR

tasks, the data collected, and the evaluation metrics used.

ing exceptions: (1) the exploratory task focused on “global
warming”; (2) the collaborative information system allowed
saving of snippets and not pages as bookmarks; (3) participants disposed of 30 minutes for solving the exploratory
task; and (4) participants disposed of co-located computers.

4.1.2

Document Dataset

In order to perform the system-mediated setting, we built
a unique document index for the two user studies including:
(1) visited pages of the whole set of participants of both
user studies; and (2) top 100 Google search results of queries
submitted by the whole set of participants. The top search
results are extracted using the Google Custom Search API1 .
We, thus, obtained a dataset with 74,844 distinct Webpages.
The datasets were then parsed to extract title and main
content from the Webpages.

Search Session Features

From search log data, we extracted three categories of features, summarized in Table 2, characterizing participants’
search actions. The first category analyzes the query submission process of each participant, for instance by emphasizing if he is better devoted to formulating queries depending on his intent level of submitting a query, modeled by his
query number or if he is looking for diversity with respect to
his used vocabulary within the successive submitted queries,
modeled by his query overlap value. In addition, we also
identified features based on query length and query success.
We assume that a query is successful if the retrieved pages
are visited for over 30 seconds. The second category analyses browsing behavior related to Webpages. For instance,
we can analyze with the page dwell time if one participant
spends a lot of time for reading one page or not. The number of visited pages, whether normalized by the number of
submitted queries or not, shows if a participant is more willing to read a lot of documents. The last category analyses
the snippet-based browsing behaviors emphasizing if users
are more willing to find interesting documents. During our
role mining methodology, we estimate the feature value for
a [0; t] time-window for each timestamp t.

User Studies

We consider two user studies, involving pairs of users,
recruited at Rutgers University. All of them are students
and got compensation for their participation. The search
tasks consisted of writing a report on an exploratory topic.
Throughout the whole session, participants had the possibility to refine their information need by exploring and reformulating queries dealing with the topic. Each task was
supported by a collaborative information system [23], which
includes a chat system and search tools enabling participants
to bookmark Webpages and save snippets. Participants were
allowed to compile snippets for building the final report. In
the background, the system recorded search log data, such
as visited and bookmarked pages, saved through snippets
and submitted queries. Statistics about the both datasets
are presented in Table 1. We notice that the repeatability
of query words represents the average occurrence number of
each word included in a query over the whole set of queries.
For instance, in the dataset US1, a query includes in average
5 words and each of them are generally used within 182 other
queries. This underlines the fact that queries are mainly issued from a reformulation process. Below, we highlight the
specificities of each user study:
US1. This study involved 60 dyads working on the exploratory topic of “Gulf oil spill”. Participants were given
25 minutes for synchronously working on the exploratory
search task and writing the report. The participants were
randomly assigned to co-located or remote settings.
US2. This study involved 10 dyads in which participants
are distinct to those implied in the first user study. The
study setup was similar to the previous one with the follow-

Roles

In accordance to the literature review, we consider the
two role-based collaborative ranking models modeling the
Gatherer/Surveyor roles [24] and the Prospector/Miner roles
[20].
The Gatherer and Surveyor roles are di↵erent considering
the fact that the Gatherer seeks for highly relevant documents and thus formulates queries with a higher overlap

than the Surveyor whereas the Surveyor spends less time on
Webpages favoring the exploration of the information space,
and accordingly the average value of query success is lower,
than the Gatherer. Thus, we can define the related role
pattern through: (1) negative correlation between the query
word overlap and spent time on Webpages features; (2) negative correlation between query word overlap and query success features. The role attribution function underlying this
couple of roles specifies that the user with the higher query
overlap feature value will be assigned to the role of Gatherer
whereas the other one will be detected as the Surveyor.
The main di↵erence between the roles of Prospector and
Miner remains on the task performed by each user. The
Prospector’s task is more devoted for reformulating queries
in order to get result diversity whereas the Miner is looking for relevant documents. Consequently, we can expect
for these roles to have a negative correlation between query
overlap and number of submitted queries features. The
underlying role attribution function specifies that the user
characterized by the most important number of submitted
queries will be assigned to the role of Prospector whereas
the other one will be detected as the Miner.

• Ra-CIR: The random baseline mining model in order
to evaluate the impact of a random version of a user
driven system mediated CIR setting in which roles are
randomly mined or not. For this purpose, we randomly
launch either the BM25 model, the Prospector/Miner
one [20] or the Gatherer/Surveyor one [24].
• RB-CIR: Role-based model as proposed in this paper.
The model requires a couple of queries, respectively for
each user. Thus, at each time a query is submitted by
a user, we identify the last query submitted by the
other user. Both queries are inputs of the CIR model.
In the case of any role is detected, we launched the
BM25 ranking model.

Metrics

For each dataset, we build the ground truth by considering
the whole set of distinct documents which have been visited
by at least two di↵erent users as relevant. Using this process,
we obtained 159 and 47 relevant documents for dataset US1
and US2 respectively.
We used collaborative-based metrics aiming at emphasizing the retrieval-based synergic e↵ect of the collaboration
[22]. Considering our CIR setting, we computed these metrics at the timestamp level as follows:

Protocol Design and Baselines

We divided the collaborative search sessions into regular timestamps of sixty seconds enabling us to detect users’
search actions di↵erences, and accordingly to predict their
roles within collaboration. We perform the following evaluation protocol:
1. For each timestamp t, mine roles that users are performing using our methodology detailed in Section 3.
2. If a role pattern is detected, use the queries submitted
between timestamps t and t + 1 with these di↵erent models:

• The precision P rec@R(g) at rank R of a collaborative
group g [22]:

• BM25-CIR: the BM25 baseline ranking model on
each single query submitted by one of the two users.
This scenario aims at simulating the user-driven session in which users perform collaboration by means of
independent search engines.

Analyzing the Mined Role Changes

In this section, we study how our proposed role mining
methodology acts in the collaborative search setting. For
this purpose, we define three metrics aiming at measuring
the changes of mined roles within a search session:

• The F-measure Fsyn @R(g) at rank R of a collaborative
group g [22]:

arises the assumption that users are di↵erent early in the session and provide the foundation to our role mining methodology. This statement is reinforced by the fact that from
75% to 100% of the collaborative groups are characterized
by significant di↵erences between collaborators after 5 minutes.

Analyzing Users’ Differences

Regarding the first stage of our methodology, we analyzed
the evolving user search actions using the features presented
in Table 2. Table 3 illustrates the average absolute di↵erences observed between collaborators of each group according to each user study with respect to features involved in
role patterns presented in Section 4.2, namely the query success (QS), the number of submitted queries (QN), the query
overlap (QO) and the dwell time of visited pages (DWP) at
each timestamp, from 1 to 30.
We can see from this table that, for the whole set of features, absolute di↵erences among collaborators of at least
one group are highlighted as positive and significant in the
beginning of the session after the first minute. Therefore, significance of collaborators’ search behavior di↵erences

1. The number of role couples, noted Ncouples ,
normalized by the number of timestamps, respectively 25
and 30 for US1 and US2, for analyzing the stability of
users’ behavior di↵erences throughout the search session.
More particularly, it measures the number of changes
within chronologically mined couples of roles, for which we
add the couple of role mined for the first timestamp. We
assume that there is a change when, from timestamp t to
timestamp t + 1, the roles assigned to the pair of users are
di↵erent. A value close to 1 means that the detected couples
of roles are di↵erent for each two successive timestamps
while a value close to 0 reflects that the pair of users have
constant behaviors throughout the search process.
2.
The number of distinct roles, noted Nroles ,
assigned to a particular user, throughout the search session
also normalized by the number of timestamps. We consider
five possibilities of individual roles: Prospector, Miner,
Gatherer, Surveyor or nothing. We note that the maximum
value, highlighting that a user is detected performing each
of these five roles in a session, is 0.2 for US1 and 0.16 for US2.
3. The couple-role ratio, noted Rchange , which helps to
analyze if, for the same detected couple of roles at two different timestamps within the search session, the same role
is assigned to the same user or if behaviors have changed
to what extend roles of collaborators became opposite. For

491

instance, a user might be Prospector in the beginning of the
session and Miner at the end. For this purpose, we compute
the ratio Rchange of the number of role couples Ncouples and
the number of distinct roles Nroles for each collaborative
search session. A value equals to 1 highlights that, even
if the assigned couple of roles to the pair of users varies
and is redundant throughout the session, roles within a couple are steadily assigned to the same user. In other words,
when a user is detected as a Gatherer at one timestamp t of
the session, if the Gatherer-Surveyor couple is again mined
at timestamp t0 , this user will be still detected as a Gatherer. A value lower than 1 for a collaborative group reflects
that, for at least one couple of roles detected at two di↵erent timestamps, each user received successively the di↵erent
associated roles, e.g. Gatherer at timestamp t and Surveyor
at timestamp t0 . In contrast, a ratio value is lower than 1
means that the couples of roles detected for the group varies
more than the evolution of users’ search behaviors when the
same couple of roles is detected.
Table 4 gives statistics of these metrics for both datasets.
More particularly, we computed the average value and the
range, under the format “average [min max]”.

building the relevance judgement for each dataset. We can
notice from Table 5 that, for the user study US2, even if the
retrieval e↵ectiveness seems to be higher for a 5-minutes time
window, results are not significantly di↵erent due to the low
number of groups. However, in the first user study, namely
US1, the optimal time window is 1 minute. The analysis
of student statistical tests highlights that the 1-minute time
window-based retrieval e↵ectiveness is significantly higher
(p < 0.05) than the other settings; and settings based on
2, 3, 4 or 5 minutes are not statistically significant between
each other. This shows that, even if the mined roles rolecouples do not vary significantly a lot, it remains however
more e↵ective to propose a mining for each minute in order
to better fit users’ search behaviors and therefore optimize
the collaboration within the search session. For this reason,
in the remainder of the paper, we consider a 1-minute time
window for mining roles of collaborators.

the retrieval e↵ectiveness.

We also performed a correlation analysis among the
couple-role ratio and the F-measure. Results showed non
significant correlations among the involved variables: respectively 0.003 and -0.003 for both dataset US1 and US2.
This highlights that the retrieval e↵ectiveness of our proposed CIR setting based on role mining does not depend on
the number of distinct mined roles for a user, but rather on
adapting the ranking model to users’ search behaviors.

US2

1.18[0.5 1.5]

We can see from Table 4 that, for both user studies, (1) the
low number of changes in terms of couples Ncouples and distinct roles Nroles and (2) the couple-role ratio value Rchange
very close to 1, highlight a certain stability in roles assigned,
first, to the pair of users, and second, to the individual users
themselves.
Indeed, the normalized number Ncouples of couples, respectively 0.13 and 0.08 for US1 and US2, reflects that general search behaviors of the pairs are stable over the session.
We notice that participants’ behaviors of the first user study
US1 are less stable than the second one US2 as we detected
more changes in terms of mined couples of roles. Both user
studies have equivalent results in terms of distinct role number mined for individual user with a value equal to 0.09.
Thus, statements are slightly opposite, although both close
to 1, with respect to the couple-role ratio for both user studies: pairs of participants in US1 are slightly more variant in
terms of global search behaviors than individual ones which
means to what extend we detected more mined couples of
roles than for the roles assignment for a solely participant.
In contrast, in US2, users’ intrinsic search behaviors fluctuate more than mined couples of roles in so far as that, for the
same couple of roles detected at two di↵erent timestamps,
the same user was labelled di↵erently.
This analysis lets us explore if the time window of the role
detection impacts the retrieval e↵ectiveness of such CIR scenario. To this aim, we estimated the retrieval e↵ectiveness of
our role-based CIR scenarios, noted RB-CIR by computing
the role mining methodology for a time window from 1 to 5
minutes. Table 5 illustrates the obtained results considering
the F-measure. Beforehand, we highlight that metric values are low due to the small number of relevant documents

Effectiveness Evaluation
Evaluating the Global Retrieval Effectiveness

Here, we measure and discuss the impact of role mining
on the overall retrieval e↵ectiveness of a collaborative search
session. To this aim, we average, for each metric, their values
over the whole set of participant groups. Significance level
used in our methodology is fixed to ↵ = 0.05.
Table 6 shows the comparative results between the retrieval e↵ectiveness of our role-based CIR setting, noted
RB-CIR, and the four baseline settings, namely BM25-CIR,
GS-CIR, PM-CIR and Ra-CIR, described in Section 4.3.
Results highlight significant improvements for most of the
collaborative-based retrieval measures. For user study US1,
mining users’ roles significantly enhance the retrieval e↵ectiveness of the overall session from +10.408% to +18.316%
for the precision metrics, except a non significant decrease
for the Prospector-Miner-based CIR scenario. In contrast,
the improvements for user study US2 are less significant due
to the fact that this study involves less collaborative sessions and therefore, the significance of student test is more
difficult to reach. Nevertheless, we obtained significant improvements from 52.786% to 63.818% with respect to the
GS-CIR baseline setting.
More generally, we notice the following general trends for
both datasets:
• Leveraging from role mining within a CIR search session overpasses the aggregation of an individual scenario highlighted by the BM25-CIR baseline. This

shows the necessity of leveraging from collaborative
search settings by analyzing users’ di↵erences and mining their roles in order to optimize the collaboration.

Thus, we can conclude that mining roles within a collaborative search session optimizes the collaboration and improves the synergic e↵ect of collaborators.

5.3.2

• Our role-based CIR scenario provides better results
than the scenario relying only on the GathererSurveyor collaborative ranking model. This highlights
that our proposed scenario is better adapted to the
constant setting of the Gatherer-Surveyor CIR model
which only merges and splits search results retrieved
from the last submitted queries of users.

Evaluating the Timestamp-based Retrieval Effectiveness

Our objective here is to analyze more in-depth retrieval
e↵ectiveness across time of our proposed methodology-based
scenario, noted RB-CIR, and the four baseline settings,
namely BM25-CIR, GS-CIR, PM-CIR and Ra-CIR. Thus,
for each timestamp t, we average over all participant groups
their F-measure at rank R for timestamp t, estimated by
combining P rec@R(g)t and Recall@R(g)t , as detailed in
Equation 7. Figure 1 illustrates the retrieval e↵ectiveness
for the five settings according to each timestamp of the
search session. For the first user study, namely US1, the
curve representing system-driven approach surrounded by
role mining, namely RB-CIR, generally overpasses the baseline curves. This statement is more slightly identifiable in
Figure 1b due to the low number of collaborative groups detected as performing a couple of roles for a particular timestamp. Therefore, di↵erences between RB-CIR and baseline
settings are more variable and non-significant. Nevertheless, we can conclude that mining roles generally optimizes
the collaboration throughout the search process. Moreover,
graphics highlight that the e↵ectiveness of our method seems
to decrease at the end of the session. It can be explained
by the fact that sessions were fixed and quite long, between
25 and 30 minutes, and we noticed during user studies that
participants were less involved in the task at the end of the

• The Prospector-Miner algorithm seems to provide better results than our scenario, however these improvements are not significant for both datasets. One possible explanation of an equivalent retrieval e↵ectiveness
as our proposed scenario might be that the ProspectorMiner CIR model analyzes the retrieved documents
and submitted queries from the beginning of the session for providing optimized document rankings. Similarly, our role mining methodology also rests on users’
actions from the beginning of the session for proposing
a better adapted CIR ranking model.
• Our role mining methodology seems to be more e↵ective than a scenario in which roles are assigned randomly. This emphasizes the reliability of our methodology for mining roles which seems to accurately match
users’ search behaviors, and accordingly optimize the
collaboration.

session. We can assume, therefore, that the cognitive e↵ort
for reformulating queries was higher which may negatively
impact the information need expression, and therefore, the
reliability of mined roles in this unstable context.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

Collaboration can be a useful strategy in many situations,
including information retrieval. As researchers have shown
[20], using collaboration one could achieve something greater
than the sum of individual searchers’ contributions. A way
to achieve this synergy is by leveraging diverse sets of skills
brought by di↵erent people [22].
In this paper, we proposed a user-driven system-mediated
approach for mining organically emerging user roles and using that information to improve upon various aspects of retrieval performance including relevance and novelty. Specifically, we presented a new role mining methodology that
helps us understand how two searchers collaborating in an
exploratory search task are di↵erent. Using this knowledge,
we were able to suggest roles for these users to follow for
the rest of their search sessions. Using simulations on two
di↵erent user study datasets for what would happen if such
suggestions were followed, we were able to show promising
results highlighting the benefit of role mining.
This work has a few limitations. For instance, it assumes
that a user’s role or in general search behavior can be extracted using his actions. The proposed algorithm also ignores any prior knowledge or preferences about the users.
This limitation can be addressed by creating a hybrid model
that takes into consideration a user’s past behavior and preferences, in addition to current actions during a search session. For the future work, we also plan to derive role patterns
through the users’ search session relying on meta-roles, not
necessarily defined within a role taxonomy.
