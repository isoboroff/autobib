ABSTRACT

written numerous papers on the topic and given dozens of
talks on the subject throughout the world. His research focuses on building formal models for Information Retrieval
- usually drawing upon different disciplines for inspiration,
such as Quantum Mechanics, Operations Research, Microeconomics, Transportation Planning and Gamification. Central to his research is the theoretical development of statistical and formal models for Information Retrieval, where his
research interests include: (i) Models for the retrieval of documents, sentences, experts and other information objects [7,
8]; (ii) Probabilistic models of user interaction and the simulation of users for evaluation [1, 4, 5]; (iii) Microeconomic
models of information interaction, specifically how cost and
effort affect interaction and performance with search systems [2]; (iv) Methods which assess the impact of search
technology on society in application areas such as, search
engine bias and the accessibility of e-Government information [6], and; (v) Searching for fun (i.e. the seven SINS of
search) [3].

Retrievability is an important and interesting indicator that
can be used in a number of ways to analyse Information
Retrieval systems and document collections. Rather than
focusing totally on relevance, retrievability examines what
is retrieved, how often it is retrieved, and whether a user
is likely to retrieve a document or not. This is important
because a document needs to be retrieved, before it can be
judged for relevance. In this tutorial, we shall explain the
concept of retrievability along with a number of retrievability measures, how it can be estimated and how it can be used
for analysis. Since retrieval precedes relevance, we shall also
provide an overview of how retrievability relates to effectiveness - describing some of the insights that researchers have
discovered so far. We shall also show how retrievability relates to efficiency, and how the theory of retrievability can
be used to improve both effectiveness and efficiency. Then
we shall provide an overview of the different applications of
retrievability such as Search Engine Bias, Corpus Profiling,
etc., before wrapping up with challenges and opportunities.
The final session of the day will look at example problems
and ways to analyse and apply retrievability to other problems and domains.
