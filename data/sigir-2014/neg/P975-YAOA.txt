ABSTRACT

ing ratings information for modeling user preferences [1, 7].
With the increasing popularity of social media, users are
allowed to actively engage in various online social activities, which provides an additional information about users
beyond ratings, among which trust relations are the most
widely studied [2, 3, 4, 5, 9].
Each user in trust rating network, e.g. Epinions, plays two diﬀerent roles: “trusters” who trust others and “trustees”
who are trusted by others. As a truster, one will be more
likely aﬀected by the existing ratings or reviews provided by
other users he/she trusts, and in the same way, as a trustee,
his/her contributions (ratings or reviews) will consequently
aﬀect others who trust him/her. The preferences of the two
roles of users can be distinct from each other [9]. E.g., for
a digital product specialist who just wants to learn cooking, he/she is more likely to trust lots of chefs while being
trusted by many digital products consumers. Hence, when
predicting user preferences for an item, it is more reasonable
to take into account both truster- and trustee-speciﬁc preferences simultaneously. By contrast, the previous methods
model the users by using only a single role [2, 3, 4, 5], or
considering the two roles independently [9]. That is, no distinction is made between the dual roles of users in the rating
generation process.
By explicitly interacting with others, such as establishing
trust relations, users show his/her preferences as a truster
or trustee. Sometimes, however, users do not explicitly but
implicitly interact with the other users. For example, supposed users a and b are very interested in cooking and trust
lots of chefs while they are not socially connected, we say a
and b interact with each other implicitly and reveal implicit
correlation, in terms of truster-speciﬁc preferences. Existing
methods are eﬀective in capturing explicit relations, while
are not suitable for discovering and modeling the above implicit interactions.
To overcome these two limitations, in this paper, we propose a novel framework, named RoRec, for modeling users’
dual role preferences for trust-aware recommendation. Varying preferences of the two roles of users are learnt by modeling explicit interactions (e.g., rating and trust) and implicit interactions. Speciﬁcally, (1) truster- and trustee-speciﬁc
preferences are estimated to ﬁt the explicit ratings and trust
relations using matrix factorization techniques. (2) Distinct
from existing methods which measure two user correlations
solely based on single links between two users, in RoRec, local links structure of trust network are leveraged to evaluate

Unlike in general recommendation scenarios where a user has
only a single role, users in trust rating network, e.g. Epinions, are associated with two diﬀerent roles simultaneously:
as a truster and as a trustee. With diﬀerent roles, users can
show distinct preferences for rating items, which the previous approaches do not involve. Moreover, based on explicit
single links between two users, existing methods can not
capture the implicit correlation between two users who are
similar but not socially connected. In this paper, we propose
to learn dual role preferences (truster/trustee-speciﬁc preferences) for trust-aware recommendation by modeling explicit
interactions (e.g., rating and trust) and implicit interactions.
In particular, local links structure of trust network are exploited as two regularization terms to capture the implicit
user correlation, in terms of truster/trustee-speciﬁc preferences. Using a real-world and open dataset, we conduct a
comprehensive experimental study to investigate the performance of the proposed model, RoRec. The results show
that RoRec outperforms other trust-aware recommendation
approaches, in terms of prediction accuracy.

3.2 Implicit Interactions

THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK

We ﬁrst introduce notations used in this paper. Let U =
{u1 , u2 , ..., un } and V = {v1 , v2 , ..., vm } be the set of users
and items respectively, where n is the number of users and
m is the number of items. We consider a rating matrix
R ∈ Rn×m describing n users’ numerical ratings on m items.
Ri,j = 0 represents the missing rating score from ui to vj .
In addition, S ∈ Rn×n is user trust relations matrix, where
Si,j is a real number within the interval [0, 1] describing the
strength of trust relation between ui and uj .
Let Wi ∈ RK and Ei ∈ RK be the K-dimension trusterspeciﬁc preference vector and trustee-speciﬁc preference vector for user ui , respectively. That is, Wi describes user ui ’s
preferences for items as a truster, and Ei represents his/her
preferences as a trustee. Similarly, let Vj ∈ RK be the Kdimension characteristic vector for item vj . Then we investigate how to learn users’ dual role preferences for more
accurate rating estimation.

In this subsection, we model implicit interactions between
two trusters/trustees by incorporating links structure of trust
network as two regularization terms to constrain the objective function.

3.2.1 Truster Regularization
Two trusters are similar if they share many out-links in
trust network, that is, they co-trust many common trustees.
By taking into all trusted trustees instead of relying on one
single link, we can obtain more robust and accurate correlation between two users even they are not explicitly connected. Considering only single link for inferring user tastes exactly is the basic idea of existing approaches, such as SoReg
[5] and TrustMF [9], with an inherent limitation of disregarding the implicit correlated users. Therefore, in order
to capture the similarity between two trusters based on the
structure of out-links, we adopt the following metric

3.1 Explicit Interactions
In this subsection, we model how the ratings and trust
relations are generated from the perspective of dual roles.

In our experiments, Si,k we use is hard value, 0 or 1. Superscribe W indicates it is the similarity between two trusters.
With the similarity between two trusters, truster regularization is to minimize the following term

3.1.1 Modeling Rating
Due to the assumption that the diﬀerent roles aﬀect rating generation in the diﬀerent way [9], every observed rating
should be determined by the user’s truster-speciﬁc preferences, as well as trustee-speciﬁc preferences. Based on this,
we estimate the rating from user ui to item vj as follows:
i,j = g(bU + bV + αWiT Vj + (1 − α)EiT Vj ),
R

We shortly review some related work. By fusing trust relations into matrix factorization techniques, several modelbased methods for modeling user preferences are proposed,
such as SoRec [4], STE [3], SocialMF [2] and SoReg [5]. However, these methods map users into a single feature space,
neglecting the diﬀerent roles assigned to users.
The most related work is TrustMF [9], which maps users into two truster and trustee space, and models the eﬀect
from trusted users on rating items. However, in TrustMF,
dual role preferences are learnt independently to estimate
ratings, while we argue that it is more reasonable to take
both truster- and trustee-speciﬁc preferences into account
simultaneously in learning process since the rating is generated from both roles. Also, TrustMF can not capture the
implicit correlation between two trusters/trustees when they
are not socially connected. We use TrustMF as our major
comparative to evaluate the performance of recommendation
in the experimental section.

that the distance between two preference vectors should be

truster-speciﬁc preference vector for ui is smoothed with

give high ratings, and popular items are more likely to be

the rating from the dual roles. We can learn all the param-

other trusters, controlled by the strength of truster similarity. Hence, for cold start users who rated few items, we
still can obtain an approximate estimate of their preference
vectors by minimizing Equation 6.

3.2.2 Trustee Regularization
Two trustees are similar if they share many in-links in
trust network, that is, they are co-trusted by many common trusters. The similarity between two trustees can be
captured by exploiting the structure of in-links as follows:

of test cases in test set. RMSE is deﬁned as:

As the deﬁnitions show, a smaller value of RMSE or MAE
indicates a better performance.
Comparison methods. As shown in Table 1, for all
comparison methods, we set respective optimal parameters
either according to corresponding references or based on our
experiments. Note that, RoRec0 is obtained by omitting
implicit interactions (i.e., setting λW , λE to 0), and RoRec1
is obtained by considering only explicitly connected users
(i.e., Sij > 0) in regularization terms in Equation 9 .

4.2 Performance Analysis
Experimental results are reported in Table 2, where K is
the dimensionality of feature spaces. The key observations
in this experimental study are summarized as follows:
(1) We can observe that the proposed method RoRec
consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, in
terms of MAE and RMSE. In particular, compared to the
best method in comparisons, TrustMF, RoRec obtains 2.9%
relative improvement under RMSE (K=10). This demonstrates that accurate dual role preferences modeling can improve the recommendation performance.
(2) RoRec, RoRec1, RoRec0 and TrustMF perform better than other methods, which map users into single feature
space. This coincides with our assumption that diﬀerentiating truster and trustee for modeling explicit interactions can
beneﬁt accurate recommendation. Further, it is observed
that RoRec and RoRec1 achieve smaller values of MAE and
RMSE over TrustMF and RoRec0. This conﬁrms the eﬀectiveness of considering explicit/implicit correlations between
users. Finally, the improvements from RoRec over RoRec1
demonstrate the advantage of additionally incorporating local structure of trust relations for constraining feature spaces
over merely single links.

where λW and λE are parameters to control the extent of
truster/trustee regularization, respectively. To reduce the
model complexity, we set λW = λE . The last term is regularization term to avoid overﬁtting, and λ is the regularization parameter. Thus, we can obtain a local minimum
of the objective function in Equation 9 by performing batch
gradient descent on preferences vectors and bias terms.

4.3 Users with Varying Number of Ratings

Acknowledgments

We ﬁrstly group users into six classes according to their
number of ratings in training set. Figure 1(a) illustrates
the distribution of the number of testing data over the six
groups. MAE generally shares the similar trend with RMSE
over diﬀerent groups, hence we only illustrate the results of
RMSE with diﬀerent dimensions in Figure 1(b) and 1(c),
respectively, due to the space limitation.
It is obvious that the proposed method RoRec generally
outperforms SoReg and TrustMF in each user group. In particular, when dimensionality is 10, RoRec improves SoReg
by 2.8 − 4.0%, and improves TrustMF by 1.7 − 5.0% respectively. We also notice that RoRec yields much smaller
RMSE than SoReg and TrustMF when more ratings are observed.
One more key observation is that RoRec obtains obvious gains of 0.035 and 0.020, under RMSE, over SoReg and
TrustMF for users in ﬁrst group (K=10), respectively. This
demonstrates the ability of RoRec to handle cold start users.
For cold start users, though very few ratings are observed,
by incorporating trust relations and the link structure for
learning an approximate estimate of their preferences, our
model can generate accurate recommendations.

CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we investigate how to model dual role preferences for improving the accuracy of trust-aware recommendation. Speciﬁcally, truster/trustee-speciﬁc preferences are
learnt to ﬁt the rating matrix and trust matrix, i.e., explicit
interactions. Further, local links structure of trust network
is exploited as two regularization terms to model implicit
interactions, thus shaping truster/trustee preference spaces.
Based on the intuition that reviews from users with high
reputation are more likely to be trusted, we could consider
the global structure of trust network to provide RoRec with
more potential power in the future work.
