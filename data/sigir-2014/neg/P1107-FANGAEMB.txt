ABSTRACT

they may be more likely to move to the new area than others who do not have prior background. On the other hand,
the change of expertise is highly personal. Some people may
always explore new areas and skills regardless of their prior
areas while some other people may stay with the same expertise all the time.
We focus on modeling the dynamics of personal expertise.
The task is closely related to expertise retrieval which has
been extensively studied in the IR community. However,
there exists very little work on investigating the dynamic
aspect of expertise. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, the existing literature contains no study on predicting
personal expertise. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model to characterize how people change or stick with
their expertise. Three factors are taken into consideration:
personality, similarity, and popularity. The proposed model
can be used to predict what are the next expertise areas a
given expert will work on, what words the expert is likely
to use in her next paper, and whether there will be a big
change in her expertise areas. We conduct the experiments
on a testbed of academic publications and the initial results
demonstrate that our proposed model can achieve much improved predictive performance over the baselines.

Personal expertise or interests often evolve over time. Despite much work on expertise retrieval in the recent years,
very little work has studied the dynamics of personal expertise. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model to
characterize how people change or stick with their expertise. Specifically, three factors are taken into consideration
in whether an expert will choose a new expertise area: 1)
the personality of the expert in exploring new areas; 2) the
similarity between the new area and the expert’s current areas; 3) the popularity of the new area. These three factors
are integrated into a unified generative process. A predictive language model is derived to estimate the distribution
of the expert’s words in her future publications. In addition,
KL divergence is defined on the predictive language model
to quantify and forecast the change of expertise. We conduct the experiments on a testbed of academic publications
and the initial results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed approach.

The existing work on expert profiling has largely focused
on finding and ranking topics for a given expert [1, 3, 8].
Very little work in the literature has investigated the temporal and dynamic aspects of expertise. Daud [4] proposed
a topic modeling approach called Temporal-Author-Topic
(TAT) to simultaneously model text, researchers and time
of research papers, but their focus was on discovering topically related researchers for different time periods. Hoonlor
[5] investigated the overall trends in computer science research without zooming in the individual researchers. To
the best of our knowledge, the closest work to ours is the
recent work by Rybak et al. [7]. They studied the temporal
expertise profiling task by proposing hierarchical expertise
profiles in which topical areas were organized in a taxonomy. They further detected changes in a person’s profile
based on snapshots of hierarchical profiles taken at various
time intervals. Our work differs from theirs in a number of
important ways. We explicitly model the factors that affect
the change of expertise. The analysis and diagnosis of these
factors can help us gain a better understanding of expertise
dynamics. Consequently, the proposed model can predict
the new topical areas the experts are likely to work on.

INTRODUCTION

People often change their expertise or interests over time.
Capturing how personal expertise evolves can better characterize expert profiles and thus facilitate the task of expertise retrieval which is an important field in Information
retrieval [2]. Various factors can affect the dynamics of personal expertise. For example, new and emerging technologies may make the existing ones obsolete and consequently
people have to adapt their skills and expertise. Moreover,
some people may have worked on the similar fields and thus

MODEL

where P (at+1 ∈ At |at , e) is used to model the conservativeness of an expert, i.e., the tendency to stick with the current
areas. We can look at how frequently the expert changes her
areas in the previous years to estimate it, specifically as follows

In this paper, we introduce the proposed model in the
context of academic publications for the sake of presentation convenience, but the model can be easily adapted to
other expert profiling scenarios. In this setting, researchers
are experts, and their publications indicate their expertise.
In the experiments, we use the Keywords in the publications to define the authors’ topical expertise areas. All the
publications associated with a given area define the area.
To understand the dynamics of personal expertise, we
need to look at how an expert’s areas evolve over time. We
make the Markov assumption by assuming the expert’s expertise areas in year t + 1, denoted by at+1 , only depends on
her areas in year t, denoted by at , not depends on the years
prior to t. This is a reasonable assumption made by many
temporal probabilistic models. Therefore, based on the sum
rule and product rule of probabilities, the probability that
the expert e will work on the area at+1 in year t + 1, denoted
by P (at+1 |e), is
X
P (at+1 |e) =
P (at+1 |at , e)P (at |e)
(1)

P (at+1 ∈ At |at , e) =

where J(At , At−1 ) measures the Jaccard similarity between
two sets At and At−1 . The intuition is that if the expert is
conservative, her current area set At and the previous area
set At−1 will have a big overlap which leads to a high Jaccard
similarity. By definition, the Jaccard similarity is always
between 0 and 1. We use the average Jaccard similarity
over T years to estimate P (at+1 ∈ At |at , e). Consequently,
the probability that e will choose a different area in year
t + 1 is simply
P (at+1 ∈ Āt |at , e) = 1 − P (at+1 ∈ At |at , e)
Let us then consider the specific area the expert will choose
in year t + 1 given the two different cases. If e stays in the
current areas, i.e., at+1 ∈ At , the probability that she will
select at+1 may be proportional to the frequency of at+1 in
e’s current publications. Specifically,

at

where P (at |e) is the probability that expert e’s current area
in year t is at , and P (at+1 |at , e) is the probability that she
will work on the area at+1 given her current area at . The
estimation of P (at |e) can be based on the relative frequency
of at in the expert’s publications in year t. Specifically,
N t ,e
, where Nat ,e is the number of times that at
P (at |e) = Nae,t
occurs in e’s publications in year t, and Ne,t is the total number of times that any topical area occurs in e’s publications
in t.
The estimation of P (at+1 |at , e) is the central component
of the proposed model which characterizes how the expert
e chooses the next area at+1 given the current one at . As
discussed in Section 1, we consider three factors to estimate
P (at+1 |at , e): 1) the personality of the expert in exploring
a new area (or the conservativeness to stay in the current
areas); 2) the similarity between the new area and the expert’s current areas; 3) the popularity of the new area. The
subsections below present the modeling of individual factors
in detail.

3.1

P (at+1 |at , e, at+1 ∈ At ) =

Nat+1 ,e,t
Ne,t

where Nat+1 ,e,t is the frequency of the area at+1 occurring in
e’s publications in year t. Ne,t is the total number of times
that any topical area occurs in e’s publications in t.

3.2

Similarity and Popularity of a New Area

If e chooses a new area, i.e., at+1 ∈ Āt , we will consider
the similarity between the new area and the current area,
and the popularity of the new area. Specifically,
P (at+1 |at , e, at+1 ∈ Āt )
= β × Sim(at+1 , at ) + (1 − β) × P op(at+1 )
where Sim(at+1 , at ) measures the similarity between two areas at+1 and at . The intuition is based on the fact that if
at+1 is more similar with the expert’s current area at , she
is more likely to explore the area at+1 . P op(at+1 ) measures the popularity of at+1 . The idea is that if an expertise area gets popular or trendy, people are likely to move
to the area regardless of their prior background (e.g., at ).
Both Sim(at+1 , at ) and P op(at+1 ) are normalized probabilities and can be calculated as follows. β is a parameter to
trade off between the two probabilities and can be estimated
by cross validation. In the experiments, we choose β = 0.5
by treating the two factors equally.

Conservativeness of an Expert

We can model how the expert e chooses the next area at+1
given the current at as the following generative process.
1. Choose to stay in the current expertise area set At
with the probability P (at+1 ∈ At |at , e)
• Choose a specific topical area at+1 from At with
the probability P (at+1 |at , e, at+1 ∈ At )
2. Choose to change to the new area set Āt with the probability 1 − P (at+1 ∈ At |at , e)

Sim(at+1 , at ) = P

• Choose a specific topical area at+1 from Āt with
the probability P (at+1 |at , e, at+1 ∈ Āt )

P op(at+1 ) =

cosine(at+1 , at )
at+1 cosine(at+1 , at )

where cosine(at+1 , at ) calculates the cosine similarity between the two areas. In the experiments, we aggregate all
the abstracts that co-occur with each area into one document. Thus, to estimate the similarity between two areas, we can compute the cosine similarity between the two
documents associated with the two areas. The popularity

The above generative process can also be viewed as a twoclass mixture model. Thus, P (at+1 |at , e) can be decomposed
as

the authors since abstracts are concise summaries of the publications. We crawled the abstracts from Google Scholar2 .
Each paper published by ACM also includes a set of keywords that authors use to specify the topics of the paper.
We treated these keywords as the topical areas of the authors, and all the abstracts co-occurring with a given keyword were aggregated to define the topical area/keyword.
We obtained the keywords of the papers from from ACM
Digital Library3 . A total number of 1,726 keywords were
extracted for our dataset. Although ACM publications also
include Categories and Subject Descriptors devised by ACM
Computing Classification System (ACC), we think they may
be too coarse and sometimes cannot accurately reflect authors’ specific expertise.
We use the data in year t for training and the data in year
t + 1 for testing. In training, only the papers with any keywords observed are used, while all the papers (in year t + 1)
are used in testing. Except in Section 4.2, the time interval
between t and t + 1 is assumed to be 1 year. In Section
4.2, we vary the time interval from 1 year up to 5 years to
investigate how the time interval affects the model performance (e.g., the 3-year interval means using year 2008, 2009,
and 2010 for training, and 2011, 2012, and 2013 for testing).
We use Lucene 4.3 for indexing with EnglishAnalyzer, and
a standard list of the stop words are removed and Porter
stemming is applied.

P op(at+1 ) of area at+1 is calculated based on the relative
frequency of the area appearing in year t.

3.3

Predictive Language Model

In the previous subsections, we obtain the predicted probability P (at+1 |e) for e over topical areas at+1 (in year t + 1).
Based on it, we can further estimate e’s probability over
words in t + 1 as follows
X
P (wt+1 |e) =
P (wt+1 |at+1 )P (at+1 |e)
(4)
at+1

where P (wt+1 |at+1 ) is the probability over words given the
topic at+1 . Here we have conditional independence assumption of wt+1 and e given at+1 . This can be viewed as a generative process in which expert chooses a topic at+1 with
probability P (at+1 |e) and then generates a word wt+1 from
the topic at+1 with probability P (wt+1 |at+1 ). We can use
P (wt+1 |e) to predict what are the next words the expert e is
likely to use, and thus the above equation defines a predictive
language model (PLM) for e. This model is especially useful
when the topical areas are not directly observed. For example, in the experiments we use the Keywords in ACM’s publications to identify experts’ topical areas, but many papers
do not include the Keywords. e.g., those not published by
ACM. Therefore, we evaluate the proposed approach based
on the observed words wt+1 instead of the areas at+1 . We
can still estimate P (at+1 |e) via Eqn. 1 by using the observed
areas/keywords of the expert.

3.4

4.2

Predictive Expertise Change Detection

Based on the predictive language model P (wt+1 |e) in Section 3.3, we can predict to what extent the expert will change
her areas for the next year. Specifically, we can achieve
this by quantifying the difference between P (wt+1 |e) and
P (wt |e) using Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence [6] as follows
X
Pt+1 (w|e)
(5)
KL(Pt+1 (w|e)||Pt (w|e)) =
Pt+1 (w|e) log
Pt (w|e)
w
where Pt+1 (w|e) = P (wt+1 |e) is the predictive language
model for year t + 1, and Pt (w|e) = P (wt |e) is the current language model estimated based on the observed words
in year t. KL divergence is a natural and well studied “distance” measure between two distributions. We can utilize it
to detect and forecast potential changes in expertise, which
could improve expertise retrieval and better understand the
dynamics of expertise.

EXPERIMENTS

Data Collection

PLM vs Baselines in Perplexity

In this experiment, we use perplexity as the evaluation
metric for our proposed predictive language model (PLM)
and baseline methods. Perplexity is a quantitative measure
for comparing language models. The value of perplexity reflects the ability of a language model to generalize to unseen
data. A lower perplexity score indicates better predictive
performance. We calculate the average perplexity across all
the researchers as follows:

P
1 X
wt+1,e ∈Dt+1,e log P (wt+1,e |e)
perplexity(Dt+1 ) =
exp −
Ne e
|Dt+1,e |
where wt+1,e denotes a word observed in e’s publications in
t + 1, and Dt+1,e is the set that includes all such words for e.
Dt+1 is the union set that includes Dt+1,e for all the experts.
Ne is the total number of experts of interest. P (wt+1,e |e) is
the language model to be evaluated. For the words only appearing in the test set Dt+1 but not in the training data, the
out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words, we assign them the proba1
where |VDt | is the size of vocabulary of training

corpus.
We compare our PLM model with three baselines with different ways to estimate P (at+1 |e). Base 1 does not consider
any change in research areas from at to at+1 , and thus assumes Pbase1 (at+1 |e) = P (at |e) where P (at |e) is the relative
frequency of at (or at+1 ) in e’s publications in year t. Base
2 assumes the probability of choosing at+1 is proportional
to
P the similarity between at and at+1 , i.e., Pbase2 (at+1 |e) =
at sim(at+1 , at )P (at |e) where sim is calculated as Eqn.
(2). Base 3 only considers the popularity of the area and
has Pbase3 (at+1 |e) = P op(at+1 ) where P op(at+1 ) is defined
in Eqn. (3). Table 1 shows the perplexity results for the

We created a testbed of expert profiles in the IR academic
community. Specifically, we retrieved 500 researchers on “information retrieval” from ArnetMiner1 , a publicly available
academic researcher website. From ArnetMiner, we could
collect the titles, venues, and years of the publications associated with the researchers. Totally, we obtained 25,255
paper titles. Instead of using the full-text publications, we
utilized the abstracts of publications as expertise evidence of

From the results, we can see that our proposed PLM
model has substantial improvement over the baselines across
all the time intervals. The baseline methods yield similar
performance with each other. All the models obtain the
best results on the 2-year time interval, which may indicate
researchers may often shift their research interests every two
years.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

This paper proposes a novel probabilistic model to investigate and predict how personal expertise evolves over time.
The model considers the personality of a given expert, the
similarity between new areas and the current ones, and also
popularity of new areas. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model. This work
is an initial step towards a promising researcher direction.
In the future work, we will explore more factors in modeling
expertise dynamics. We will also conduct a more comprehensive set of experiments to evaluate the proposed model
on large-scale testbeds.

Predicting Large Changes in Expertise Areas

6.
[1]

We rank all the researchers based on the KL divergence,
defined in Section 3.4, from 2012 to 2013. The researchers
with large KL divergence are predicted to have a relatively
considerable change in their topical areas in the new year.
Figure 1 shows the top 5 researchers with the largest predicted KL divergence from 2012 and 2013. To see whether
the results make sense, we dig into the researchers’ previous publications, and find out that they all have worked
on a quite diverse set of research areas. For example, Kotagiri Ramamohanarao’s fields include Machine learning, Data
mining, Information retrieval, Logic programming, Distributed
systems, Bioinformatics, Medical imaging, and so on. The
frequent change of areas would lead to low value in P (at+1 ∈
At |at , e) (see Section 3.1, which is based on Jaccard similarity between two area sets At and At+1 ), and thus would be

In this section, we apply the proposed model in Eqn. 1 to
calculate the probability P (at+1 |e) that e will choose area
at+1 in year 2013. Based on the descending order of this
probability, we can predict the top areas for e in 2013. Table 2 lists the top 3 areas for three researchers, along with
the researchers’ top areas in 2012 calculated based on the
frequency of the areas in theirs publications. Again, the
areas are extracted and defined by the keywords in ACM
publications (see Section 4.1).
From the results, we can see that the proposed model
can predict different top areas for 2013 from 2012, while
still reserving the areas of strength of the researchers. For
example, Dawei Song’s top areas in 2012 did not include
“Query expansion”, but our model gave such a prediction
for 2013. From the titles of his publications in DBLP 4 , we
can verify that at least two of Dawei Song’s papers in 2013
are related to the area “Query expansion”. On the other
hand, our model still kept some of his previous top areas
such as “Query suggestions” in the forecast, which was a
good prediction since his publications in 2013 indeed had
quite a few about this topic. We can also have some similar
findings for other two researchers in the table.
