ABSTRACT

Look-a-like modelling, anomaly detection, time series prediction are commonly used to identify out of sequence observations at individual or aggregate levels. Applications of
such modelling techniques include fraud detection, web page
personalization, market segmentation, offline and online targeting etc. The techniques are used across retailers, publishers, finance and other domains. Our experiments show that
methods based on click-stream analysis provide significantly
better predictive capabilities than other techniques based on
demographic attributes.
In this demonstration we showcase a real-time dashboard
for marketers, which helps them visualize browsing patterns
of visitors on their website. Visitors could be segmented
based on various attributes like their geo-location, device
type etc. Moreover we also predict the likelihood of visitor
to make a purchase based on supervised learning algorithms.
Marketers have the ability to select a visitor or group of similar visitors to form a market segment. Offers or promotional
campaigns can be pushed to these selected users, increasing
their chances of making a purchase.

Identifying and targeting visitors on an e-commerce website
with personalized content in real-time is extremely important to marketers. Although such targeting exists today, it
is based on demographic attributes of the visitors. We show
that dynamic visitor attributes extracted from their clickstream provide much better predictive capabilities of visitor
intent. In this demonstration, we showcase an interactive
real-time user interface for marketers to visualize and target
visitor segments. Our dashboard not only provides the marketers understanding of their visitor click patterns, but also
lets them target individual or group of visitors with offers
and promotions.

INTRODUCTION

Organizations are embracing online platforms to increase
their reach and reduce operational costs of brick and mortar
stores. Of late even software companies are moving towards
online purchase and subscription models. However the online conversion rates are typically in the range of 1-3 % [4],
which is significantly less compared to conversions in offline
world. Hence they are interested in analysing online visits
to understand low conversion rates and influence customers
to make purchases. Techniques like web-page personalization, campaigns, offers etc. are routinely adopted to persuade visitors. These techniques increase conversions at the
cost of significant marketing budget. As marketing to nonpurchasers amounts to wasted dollars, marketers would like
to identify visitors who would best respond to a campaign.
Such techniques today are based on demographic attributes
of the visitors like city, state, age, income etc. Our approach
to identify this target group is based on visitor click-streams.
Click-stream refers to the sequence of URLs that are visited by the customer in addition to meta-data such as geolocation, purchase information, page categories, referrer etc.
This information is used to gain insight into the user intent,
and subsequently predict potential leads, churn or any such
desired metric. Clustering of visitor sessions by appropriate
features generates market segments for targeted campaigns.

RELATED WORK

Primarily analytics involved exploration or generating insights from historic data and using it for future decisions.
Of late industry has started moving towards the direction
of providing real-time analytics. Companies like Chartbeat1
provide real-time dashboard to marketers showing various
attributes of visitors on the website. However they lack
predictive capabilities to distinguish purchasers from nonpurchasers. Further, certain companies like Netmining2 provide purchase propensity score of visitors. Although such
dashboards are useful, there is no action-ability that a marketers could take, to increase conversions on his website. Our
technology overcomes these shortcomings by not only providing information about visitor attributes in real-time, but
also the ability to segment visitors by their on-site behaviour
and appropriately target them. Such personalization leads
to higher conversion and more revenue to marketers.

ARCHITECTURE

This section describes overall architecture of the system,
input data, dashboard, propensity scoring mechanism and
targeting. Figure 1a shows the overall architecture of our
system. When visitor clicks on a web-page, click information is fed into our processing engine. The processing modules store the data in persistent storage as well as compute
propensity score for the visitor.

Data: We use data of visitors on the Adobe website3 . Every visitor click captured includes information such as visitor
identifier (obtained from cookies), IP, page URL, referrer,
meta-data associated with the page such as category, product price, whether the click resulted in purchase and so on.
The above information is collected from standard methods
such as javascript code, that request a single pixel images
from the server, resulting in a hit. Additional information
such as visitor location is derived from the IP and appended
to the click-stream. The data is streamed to the processing
engine using streaming technologies such as Storm4 .
Back-end system and Data Store: Our processing module is implemented in python. We use Apache HBase5 as our
data store. HBase is a columnar, nosql database which has
fast response time for storage and retrieval.

many or as few visitors similar to the selected visitor. Finally the marketer can target the selected visitor segment
in real-time with appropriate offers (item ’g’). The promotional offers are pushed on the website for the selected users.
Propensity Scoring: Here we briefly describe the mechanism used for computing the propensity score of the user.
Various techniques have been explored in literature for classifying purchasers and non-purchasers on website [2, 1]. Markov
chains and HMMs have been popular approaches for modelling click-stream data. Our approach is based on building
features from the click-stream data, computing similarity
score between visitor pairs and using kNN to classify visitors. The details of methodology for classifying visitors is
described in [3], where we show that our methods outperform prior-art systems. The same methodology is used to
identify visitors similar to any selected visitor, thus creating
a visitor segment.
Targeting: Finally we provide the marketer with the ability to push promotions, discounts or other such offers to
selected visitor segments. Our system creates rules based
on the selected attributes and offers. The rules are used to
dynamically deliver personalize content to the visitor. We
also provide predicted lift from the offer based on historic
data.

VISUALIZATION

Figure 1b shows our real-time dashboard, accessible to
the marketer. Item ’a’ shows zoom-able sundial representing site-sections of the website. For instance we see regions representing adobe.com, blogs and help, creative cloud
among others. Each visitor is represented as a bubble on
the dial, with size and color representing the time spent
by the visitor on the website and their likelihood of making a purchase respectively. One could zoom into specific
site-sections by clicking on the respective slice and understand visitor browsing patterns. For instance visitors could
be spending more time on certain site-sections than others
or certain site-sections could have higher conversions than
others. Such information could help the website owner optimize the page content, link structure to improve conversion.
Marketer could use the slider as shown in item ’b’ to filter
and view visitors with propensity scores in a given range.
Purchase patterns from different geo-locations are visualized
on a map shown in item ’c’. States are coloured based on
their conversion rates on a scale ranging from red to green,
with higher conversions shown in green and lower conversions coloured red. This information could then be used to
provide offers to visitors from areas with lower conversion.
We also show donut visuals in item ’d’ for two sample visitor attributes like device type or cart status. Marketer could
choose which attributes he would like to view among a large
number of available attributes. Clicking on a given visitor
reveals additional information about the visitor such as the
URLs visited and time spent, shown in item ’e’. Slider provided in item ’f’ provides the marketer ability to include as

CONCLUSION

In this demonstration we have created a real-time dashboard for marketer to visualize on-site traffic patterns and
target selected user segments with offers. Marketers have
the ability to create appropriate visitor segments for targeting based on various attributes. Our work combines visualization, predictive capabilities and targeting in real-time,
outperforming existing solutions.
