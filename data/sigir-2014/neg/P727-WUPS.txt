ABSTRACT

(A)

Trending search suggestion is leading a new paradigm of image
search, where user’s exploratory search experience is facilitated
with the automatic suggestion of trending queries. Existing image search engines, however, only provide general suggestions and
hence cannot capture user’s personal interest. In this paper, we
move one step forward to investigate personalized suggestion of
trending image searches according to users’ search behaviors. To
this end, we propose a learning-based framework including two
novel components. The first component, i.e., trending-aware weightregularized matrix factorization (TA-WRMF), is able to suggest
personalized trending search queries by learning user preference
from many users as well as auxiliary common searches. The second component associates the most representative and trending image with each suggested query. The personalized suggestion of
image search consists of a trending textual query and its associated trending image. The combined textual-visual queries not only
are trending (bursty) and personalized to user’s search preference,
but also provide the compelling visual aspect of these queries. We
evaluate our proposed learning-based framework on a large-scale
search logs with 21 million users and 41 million queries in two
weeks from a commercial image search engine. The evaluations demonstrate that our system achieve about 50% gain compared
with state-of-the-art in terms of query prediction accuracy.

INTRODUCTION

Today’s Web interfaces for information seeking have predominantly focused on facilitating the “search” behavior when users
are exploring the Web. Recent studies have found that the typical
information retrieval activity by typing short queries into search
boxes are not enough to satisfy users’ search intent. This is particularly true for image search, where a significant part of queries
is from recommendation (e.g., inspired from browsing a webpage,

triggered by a popular social event, etc.). A new search paradigm—
exploratory search—which facilitates user’s searching experience
with browsing (i.e., recommendation) to foster seeking and investigation, is therefore emerging.
This paper is concerned about providing image search engine
users with trending queries (via a combined textual-visual form),
which are highly related to users’ personal interest, to further enhance their exploratory search experience (as shown in Fig. 1).
Knowing the trends that most users are searching for, not only can
increase user engagement by pro-actively suggesting trending news
[1], but also serve for the detection of socially trending events, e.g.,
detecting influenza epidemics in a short latency [11].
The query log data in a search engine provide rich information
of what users are interested [4, 24]. When large amount of users
search for similar information, there emerges a trend, ranging from
worldwide breaking news to celebrity gossips. Many search engines have already provided related services. For example, Bing
Popular Now detects general trending searches 1 . To tailor the
trending topics for personalization purpose, Yahoo! Trending Now
2
and Google Trends 3 suggest the trending searches based on user
locality information. Google also provides search trends analytic in
a set of pre-defined categories 4 . Besides, Bing serves with trending
image searches 5 , which can dig out different kinds of trends from
image search log. Please see Figure 1(A) for an example. However, the suggested queries from most existing online services are not
tailored to user preferences.
There has been extensive research on trending search. Dong et
al. investigate the detection of trending searches [10]. Bawab et
al. introduce the locality-aware trending search detection in Yahoo! [1]. Instead of using simple search statistics, Golbandi et
al. propose a linear auto-regression model to shorten the latency
of trending detection [12]. Meanwhile, the trending queries can be
also mined from social networks [7, 28].
It can be observed that there are two unsolved issues in existing applications. First, the suggested trending queries from existing search engines are not personalized or only related to locality
while ignoring individuals’ search preferences [1]. However, when
browsing trending queries, users are always preferring the results
tailored to their personal interests. As shown in Fig. 1, user #1125
is interested in “Golden Globes” and “Baseball” related topics according to his/her search behaviors. It is therefore more reasonable
to suggest related trending searches to this user. Second, besides
personalized suggestion of textual queries, the selection of representative image for each trending search is able to facilitate user’s
understanding of the bursty events. However, this is often overlooked in existing works. Though some search engines, such as
Google and Bing, have provided trending image search, the selection of representative images highly depends on editorial effort and
does not consider visual aspect.
Motivated by the above observations, we propose a novel learningbased framework for personalized suggestion of trending image
search by mining image search log data. The suggested textualvisual queries, each represented by the combined form of a textual
query and its associated representative image, are not only socially
trending due to their burst nature, but also personalized to users’
search behaviors. The proposed framework consists of two components. The first component includes a novel trending-aware weight1

regularized matrix factorization (TA-WRMF) algorithm which suggests the personalized trending textual queries by formulating the
process as one-class collaborative filter problem. The second component selects the most representative and trending image for each
textual search. Specifically, we investigate how to extract discriminative features from image search log, including popularity, visual
consistency, as well as trending factor. The suggested textual-visual
trending image search queries can improve user engagement and
therefore foster user’s exploratory search experience.
In summary, we make the following contributions:
• We have proposed a learning-based framework to personalize trending image search suggestion by mining users’ clickthrough data. The framework consists of two novel components, i.e., TA-WRMF for personalized trending query suggestion and representative trending image selection.
• We conduct comprehensive evaluations on a large-scale search
log data from a commercial search engine and validate the
effectiveness of our framework.
The remaining of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2
reviews related work. Section 3 presents the framework. Section 4
and 5 analyze the dataset and experiments, respectively, followed
by the conclusions in Section 6.

2. RELATED WORK
The research related to trending image search suggestion includes
trending search detection, query suggestion/auto-completion, and
representative image selection.
Trending search detection. Most previous research on trending
search detection depends on the statistics of search queries. Dong
et al. detect the trending searches by the likelihood differences of
query search in different time windows [10]. Bawab et al. extend
the idea and further introduce the locality-aware likelihood to derive local trending searches [1]. Chen et al. propose classificationbased method to distinguish stable, one time burst, multiple time
burst, and periodic queries [9]. Golbandi et al. propose a linear
auto-regression model to shorten the latency of trending search detection [12]. In addition to the search trends, other research works
detect the trends from blogosphere [19], online news [8], and social media, such as Twitter [7] and Youtube [28]. To the best of our
knowledge, there is few attempt for personalizing trending search
suggestion with representative images.
Query suggestion and auto-completion. Query suggestion and
query auto-completion are two closely related research topics. Query
suggestion returns a list of ranked queries with respect to a given
query, while query auto-completion returns queries with the first
few letters in common with user’s input. In general, there are two categories of methods. The first branch is session-based methods, where the basic idea is that the queries co-occurring in the
same sessions are the candidates for suggestion [2, 14]. The second
branch is based on document-click relationship [6, 23]. The querydocument bipartite graph is built from search log. Two queries are
assumed similar if the corresponding clicked URLs are identical
[20].
However, previous research only focuses on the condition with
input query and does not learn any latent topics or consider personalization. Ma et al. attempt to jointly learn the latent topics of
users, queries, and URLs via collaborative filtering (CF) and define
the query similarity on the learned latent space [22]. However, their
approach needs the For personalization, Shokouhi et al. propose to
build personal profile considering long-term search history, shortterm history (previous searches in the same session), age, gender,

and region [31]. However, their approach only leverages personal
search history which provides limited knowledge for understanding
users.
Representative image selection. The criteria of representative
image selection can be summarized as: (1) visual consistency—
the selected image should be visually similar to many others [16,
33, 35]; (2) visual orthogonality—two similar images should not
be included [32]; and (3) relevance—how relevant the image is to
this query, which can be measured by popularity (i.e., the number
of queries for this image) [16] or textual-visual similarity [33]. In
addition, Kennedy et al. adopt a time information as criteria [16].
In summary, we move one step forward in this paper for personalized trending image search suggestion. Different from query
suggestion/auto-completion, we do not need any query as input.
For representative image selection, we extract features from image
search log rather than image collection and further investigate the
trending-aware time feature.

Trending image search detection

We start with trending search detection. To find buzzing search
queries, we adopt similar strategy to [1]. First, only top frequent
search queries (i.e., 10, 000 in this work) are kept and only their
buzz score will be computed. The buzz score BS(qj ) of the query
qj is defined by
BS(qj ) =

d−n

s=d−1


1 
P (qj |Qd ) − P (qj |Qs ) ,
d−s

(1)

where P (qj |Qd ) is the likelihood of query qj given the query set
Qd of day d. Instead of choosing max difference [1], i.e.,
maxs {P (qj |Qd ) − P (qj |Qs )},

(2)

we adopt weighted sum to aggregate all the differences information
within several days. The reason is that we prefer to detect the search
with popularity rising dramatically at current moment. However,
the max difference cannot distinguish this issue.
Next, we have to single out a representative search on behalf of
a group of queries with similar semantics. Thus, the concept of
generalized count is adopted and shown to be robust and efficient
in [1]. That is, the query qi gives a generalized count for qj if
qi is a substring of qj , e.g., “President Barack Obama” provides
a generalized count for “Barack Obama.” The buzz score of the
search query qj is then modified as in [1]:


(3)
BS  (qj ) = BS(qj ) × log 1 + v(qj , d) + v ∗ (qi , d) ,

3. APPROACH
In this section, we introduce the proposed framework of learning
to personalize trending search suggestion. The framework is shown
in Figure 2. After preprocessing, trending image search queries are
detected based on the statistics of queries from the image search
log, as shown in Figure 2(A) (Section 3.1). Then we learn the user
interests (U = [u1 · · · ui · · · u|U| ]) and trending search attributes
(Q = [q1 · · · qj · · · q|Q| ]) simultaneously via matrix factorization
(MF) on the click-through matrix (R), as shown in Figure 2(B).
To leverage the information from common searches without sacrificing the accuracy of trending searches, we propose the trendingaware weighted regularized matrix factorization (TA-WRMF). The
personalized suggestion (i.e., re-ranked list of trending searches)
depends on the inner product of the learned user interests and trending query attributes (Section 3.2). Moreover, to better visualize the
search trends, we select the most representative trending image for
each suggested textual query, as shown in Figure 2(C). In addition to relevance and visual consistency, we propose burstiness as
the criteria for trending-aware image selection (Section 3.3). The
suggested personalized trending query is in the textual-visual form with both the textual query and its representative image. In the
following sections, we will elaborate each component in details.

where v(qj , d) is the count of qj during day d and v ∗ (qj , d) is the
generalized count of qj during day d. With the help of generalized
count, “Barack Obama” would be preferred, as “President Barack
Obama” and “Barack Obama” have similar BS. In practice, the
search queries with the top BS  can be sent to the editorial staffs to
manually check the trending search quality [1].

3.2

Personalized trending search suggestion

To personalize search query suggestion for each user, it is reasonable to learn personal interest from user’s search log. However,
the search log data of individual users are usually sparse and thus
might provide very limited personal knowledge. Leveraging users
with similar search queries to expand personal interest is a feasible
solution. Moreover, with the click-through data, we can assume

729

that users are implicitly interested in the issued search queries. The
non-clicked search queries might be uninterested or unknown. This
scenario is similar to the one-class collaborative filtering (OCCF)
problem, where only the positive data are provided and could be
solved by matrix factorization techniques (MF) [25]. Here the major concern is whether the sparsity issue exists, which is a common
problem to deal with search log data [3], and whether it will affect
the performance. In this work, as the suggestion targets are trending
searches, i.e., the searches would be issued by many users during a
short period of time, there is no sparsity issue. Therefore, we can
apply MF technique to solve the OCCF problem in this work.
As a result, inspired from [25], which is well-known for OCCF problem, we apply the weight-regularized matrix factorization
(WRMF) as our model 6 , which is formulated as follows:

2
J(U, Qt ) =
Wij (Ri,j − uTi qtj ) + λ(U2F + Qt 2F ), (4)

idea is similar to solve the OCCF problem, except that we apply the weighted regularization twice—once for the imbalance of
positive/negative pairs and the other for the imbalance of trending/common searches. Then, we define the weighted matrix (W)
as:
⎧
WP
Rij = 1 ∧ qj ∈Qt
⎪
⎪
⎪
⎨
1
Ri,j = 1 ∧ qj ∈Qc
Wij =
(6)
⎪
W
Ri,j = 0 ∧ qj ∈Qt
⎪
⎪ N
⎩
n
WN × Wi,j
Rij = 0 ∧ qj ∈Qc ,
where WP > 1 is to increase the importance of positive (ui , qjt )
pairs, and WN < 1 is to control the importance of negative (ui , qj )
n
pairs. Wi,j
is only applied on negative (ui , qjc ) pairs. With such
a design, the pairs containing qjt are more important/positive pairs.
The imbalance issues are then resolved. As a result, we can not
only leverage the information of common searches but also ensure
the accuracy of trending searches.
Scalability and Sampling. However, one of the drawbacks of
using all the queries is the scalability issue. The complexity would
be O(|U| × |Q| × z × T ) where T is the number of optimization iterations. The time consumption would be intolerable due to
enormous number of queries in real world. To reducing the complexity with competitive performance, we adopt user-oriented samn
pling strategy to approximate Wi,j
. The number of negative samns
pled pairs Ni is proportional to the number of positive pairs Nip
(Nip = j Rij ) of a user ui . m = Nins /Nip is the ratio of negative
sample over positive pairs. Then, we have

i,j

where R is the click-through matrix, Rij = 1 indicates user ui
has issued query qj in the training set, and (ui , qj ) is called a positive pair. Rij = 0 indicates user ui has never issued query qj
in the training set, and (ui , qj ) is called a negative pair. U =
[u1 · · · ui · · · u|U| ] is the user matrix where ui is the latent interest
of user ui . ui is a z-dimensional vector, where z is the number of
latent topics. Qt = [qt1 · · · qti · · · qt|Qt | ] is the trending search matrix where qtj is the latent attributes of trending search qjt and is a
z-dimensional vector. Qt is the trending search set. Please note that
we use superscript t to denote the detected trending image queries
to differentiate from general queries. Qt assigns the queries to the
latent interests. W is the weight matrix which control the importance of positive pairs and is defined by


Rij = 1
Wij =

Wijn ≈

m × Nip
Nins

(7)

where Nin (Nin = |Q|− j Rij ) is the number of negative pairs of


ui . Then, the complexity becomes O N p (1+m+|Qt |)×z×T ≈
p
O(|U| × z × T ), where N is the total number of positive (ui , qj )
pairs in the training data 7 . To solve Eqn. (4), stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) is further applied for better efficiency [17], and the
iteration formulations are


ui = ui + α − Wij (Rij − uTi qj )qj + λui ,
(8)


T
qj = qj + α − Wij (Rij − ui qj )ui + λqj ,

where Wijn should be smaller than 1 because positive (ui , qjt ) pairs
are more significant in the OCCF problem to avoid the imbalance
issue. However, if only trending searches are used for user understanding, it is possible to suffer short information. The number
of trending searches, i.e., |Qt |, is extremely small compare to the
number of user |U|. Therefore, the low-rank approximation might
barely mine useful knowledge from it. The first term of the objective function J(U, Qt ) in Equation (4) targets on modeling the
two latent spaces of user and query, respectively. The similarity
between two spaces are defined by inner product. The second term
is to reduce the length of user and query factors, which decreases
the model complexity to prevent data overfitting.
Another issue is how to use the information from both the trending and common searches (i.e., queries) as much as possible to
learn the latent relationship between users and trending searches. qit , Qt , and Qt can be replaced by qi , Q, and Q, respectively. Qt = Qt ∪ Qc , where Qc is the common search set, and
qjc (qjc ∈ Qc ) represents a common search query. Unfortunately,
this setting neglects the importance of trending searches, which is
the real suggestion target. Treating each common search equally
to each trending searches might sacrifice the accuracy of trending
searches due to the imbalance issue (|Qc |  |Qt |).
TA-WRMF. Motivated from the above observations, aiming at
leveraging the information from common searches without sacrificing the accuracy of trending searches, we propose a novel trendingaware weighted regularized matrix factorization (TA-WRMF). The

where α is the learning rate and λ is the regularization term 8 . At
training phase, we separate part of (ui , qj ) pairs from training data
to form a validation set. When the cost function J(U, Qt ) does
not decrease for c (c = 20) continuous iterations on validation
set, convergence is claimed. The overall optimization process is
summarized in the Algorithm 1. In short, our proposed TA-WRMF
adopts weighted regularization twice to solve the two imbalance
issues and learns better latent structures of users and search queries.

3.3

Trending-aware representative image selection

The selected trending images are expected to facilitate the understanding of trending searches. Different from previous works mining from social image collections, we target at digging information
from the commercial image search log. In this section, we investigate the widely adopted representative image selection features,
i.e., relevance and visual consistency [16], as well as the features
related to search popularity, i.e., burstiness.

6
Many other proposed MF techniques to fit different rank-oriented optimization goals [18, 27, 30, 34] can also be adopted. But in this work, we
aim to propose a unified strategy to solve the personalized trending search
suggestion problem.


N p = i,j Rij and N p ∝ |U|. m and |Qt | are constants.

λ in Eqn. (4) and α in Eqn. (8) are decided by cross-validation and both
are set as 0.01 in the proposed TA-WRMF for all the experiments.

Burstiness. The users not only care about the trending searches
but also the reason why they are buzzing. As in Figure 2(C), people
would issue “Mila Kunis” at the moment because they are interested in her gossip. Thus, in addition to returning the image with high
relevance, it is intuitive to select the one with higher descriptivity of
trending search. The image with bursty large amount of increasing
clicks from the trending search is assumed with better descriptivity. Hence, we adopt the burstiness Pb (Ik |qjt ) of the image Ik given
trending search qjt as the measurement of descriptivity, which is
similar to Eqn. (1) and can be formulated as
Pb (Ik |qjt ) =

Visual Consistency. It is important to determine the representativeness under the assumption that an image with more similar
neighbors should have higher chance to be selected [16, 35]. The
Bag-of-Visual-Word model on the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) features is applied to compute the visual similarity
Sim(Ik , Il ) of a pair of images (Ik , Il ) [21, 26]. Then, a random walk process is adopted to derive the visual consistency [13].
For each trending search qjt , each image Ik with ckj > 0 is a node nk and forms a image set Itj . nk has a directed edge ek,l
to node nl if Il belongs to the k-Nearest Neighbor (k = 5) of
Ik , denoted by kN N (Ik ). The weight of edge ek,l is given by
Sim(Ik ,Il )

. Therefore, the visual consistency Pv (Ik |qjt )
Is ∈kN N (Is ) Sim(Ik ,Is )

We have conducted experiments (including trending search detection and personalize trending search suggestion) on a large-scale
search log from a commercial image search engine. The image
search logs were collected in the first two weeks of Nov. 2012.
Each entry of the log contains five elements <user, query, U RL,
time, nationality>. The dataset contains 21 millions unique users, 41 unique millions queries, and 61 unique millions URLs. Only
the search logs in US are used in our data.
Furthermore, in the raw search logs, there are many spam users
who aim to promote specific searches to be detected as trends and
continuously issue many queries in a short period of time. To reduce spam queries and users, we regard the users who issue more
than 50 search queries in a single search session as spam users and
remove their query logs. Two consecutive queries issued within a
specific time threshold by a single user are considered in the same
search session as defined by [5]. Here, the time threshold is set 30
min to define a single session.
Moreover, search queries with low frequency are barely considered trends and provide little information for latent topic learning.
Thus, we remove the search queries below a certain threshold (i.e.,
3 in this work). After spam users and low frequent searches removal, there are 15 millions unique users, 9 unique millions queries
and 61 unique millions URLs in the final dataset.
One possible issue of collaborative filtering is the data sparsity
(cold-start) problem. However, from Figure 3, trending searches
have issued by many users, and thus might not suffer the cold-start
problem. This statistic is supportive to collaborative filtering, especially our proposed TA-WRMF.

The trending search detection is based on Eqn. (1) and Eqn. (3).
s is set 3, i.e., the trending strength is referred to the last three days.
Searches with top 100 trending scores are claimed trending for evaluation. For the personalized suggestion, we will first conduct
personalized suggestion on editor-labeled trending searches. Then,
in the main experiments, trending searches claimed in the detection
stage are directly put in the suggestion list for further personalized
ranking without editor selection. There are three reasons for this

nature, i.e., burstiness. How to fuse the features for better performance will be covered in the future.

Figure 4: Performance in terms of MAP. (A) shows the overall trending search suggestion performance of all the baselines and our
proposed TA-WRMF, which has the best MAP result. In (B) only the issued (ui , qj ) pairs (Ri,j = 0) are possibly consider relevant,
and TA-WRMF is also competitive. On the other hand, in (C), only the issued (ui , qj ) pairs (Ri,j = 1) are possibly regarded as
relevant. Our TA-WRMF approaches most closely to the upper bound achieved by F P + M P C among the CF-based methods. In
short, TA-WRMF has competitive performances in both conditions, and thus outperform other methods on MAP.

where Ud is the testing user set corresponding to the trending searches of day d, relut (k) indicates whether the k-th trending search is

For trending search representative image selection, we focus on
addressing the effectiveness of burstiness. Therefore, three features
will be directly compared in the experiments without further fusion.
The top 20 trending searches are selected from editor-labeled set
during 2012/11/04–2012/11/13. The representative images are automatic generated by the corresponding features. Only the highest
scored image is viewed as the representative image by each feature. Then, a user study is conducted to evaluate the results. The
information why the trending searches were buzzing is manually
searched by each subject and then aggregated as the reference to
facilitate the subject to get familiar with the background of trending events. As a result, we invited six subjects (four males and two
females) to score the representativeness of each image, i.e., the ability to visualize the reasoning of buzzing. Each user was required
to score the selected 20 trending searches. In total, 60 images (20
queries × 3 representative images by each features) with the scores
scale from 1-10 (the higher, the better) are annotated.

setting: 1) It is hard to manually label the trending searches during
2012 at current time; 2) It is closer to the real application scenario.
For example, existing trending suggestion systems display at most
20 trending searches. It is therefore more convincing to enlarge
the general trending list for further re-ranking; 3) The automatically detected trending searches also have similar properties, e.g.,
click-through rate, to the editor-selected. The framework should be
applicable when more editor-selected trending searches are available.
Table 1 lists the personalized suggestion evaluation protocol. We
simulate the suggestion evaluation based on evaluation of prediction problem. Assume the target is to suggest the trending searches
of day d (e.g., day 4) to the users in day (d + 1) (i.e., day 5 in the
example). The users who have issued any trending searches in the
day (d + 1) will be considered as testing users. For each testing
user, the corresponding trending searches issued by him/her in the
day (d + 1) are considered relevant.
Generally, the search logs from (d − s) to day d (e.g., day 1 to
day 4 in the example) are considered as training data. But for better
experimental efficiency, in addition to testing users, only any other user who has ever issued any trending search at least generated
three queries in the training data is regarded as training user. The
query qj issued by training user ui is included as training query.
After one set of experiment (day 1 to day 5), we shift one day (e.g.,
day 2 to day 6 in the Table 1) to have another training and testing
data. Then, the evaluation process is repeated. Totally, we have 9
sets (2012/11/04–2012/11/12) in the experiments. For evaluation,

Figure 5: Examples of personalized suggestions. For each user, the top 20 in the ranked list are suggested. We select some suggested
trending searches (with images) and issued queries in the search logs to show the semantic consistency between the textual and visual
queries. Each color represents a topic (e.g., U.S politics) mined from the image search logs. Each number in the parenthesis following
a suggested trending search means the original ranking by MPC. For example, “neuschwanstein castle” is ranked 72-th by MPC,
but is promoted to top-20 by the proposed TA-WRMF.
• Singular Vector Decomposition (SVD). Assume all the negative samples as zero and have the same error weight, i.e.,
Wij = 1 for all positive (ui , qj ) pairs and directly apply
SVD on R to derive U and Q. Note that in SVD, all queries
are included in the training data.

the other three are CF-based methods. The baselines are introduced
as follows.
• Most Popular Candidates (MPC) [2]. This is the frequencybased general suggestion without personalization. We commonly suggest the trending searches ranked by trending scores to all the users.

• Weighted Regularized Matrix Factorization (WRMF). WRMF is based on Eqn. (4). There are two settings for the search
query set: 1) the query set only consists of trending searches
(Q = Qt ), and Wij depends on Eqn. (6); and 2) the query
set consists all queries in the training data (Q = Qt ∪Qc ) and
n
Wij follows Eqn. (5), such that Wi,j
is also approximated
by the sampling strategy described in Section 3.2.

• Personal Frequency (PF) + MPC. Inspired by [31], we directly represent the personal interests by his/her past search
history. That is, the search with higher frequency, or called
issued, is ranked higher. However, the coverage of PF is not
enough. So, the overall personalized suggestion list depends
on the linear combination of PF and MPC.

5.3

• Item-Based Collaborative Filtering (IBCF) [29]. For each
Rij
item (search) is normalized L1 norm R̄ij =  R
, and
ij

then L1 distance is applied. So, the suggestion score for
trending search qjt to user ui is measured by
Si,j =

Table 2 shows the trending search detection results. First, the
weight average scheme performs slightly better (on both MAP and
Recall) than the max difference scheme as in [1]. The major reason is that the weighted average scheme prefers the searches with
the statistical volume curves ascending in the convex shape. max
difference, on the other hand, is neutral for the shape. However,

if the curve is in the concave shape, the search should be trending earlier rather than the current moment and this situation cannot
be distinguished by max difference. Therefore, weighted average
has slightly better performance. Besides, our approach achieves
good coverage (Recall) of the trend detection. 90% editor-labeled
trending searches during the period are discovered by our detection
algorithm. Thus, if the personalized suggestion works well on the
automatic detected trending searches, it should perform well given
editor-labeled trending searches.

(E) Reason for the trend

5.4 Evaluation of personalized trending image
search suggestion

Figure 7: Example of trending-aware representative image selection. Four images are preferred by different methods (A-D),
and (E) provides why “Don Lemon” was buzzing during the period. The Twitter feud between “Don Lemon” and “Jonah Hill”
caused the burst and only the burstiness boosted the headshots
of the two (A) to the top rank.

The personalized suggestion on the 20 editor-labeled trending
searches improves the MAP from 0.37 (MPC) to 0.55 (TA-WRMF),
which supports the intuition of personalized suggestion. Then, we
focus on showing and analyzing the results on the 100 automatically detected search trends. From Figure 4 (A), we can see that
TA-WRMF outperforms all other baselines with 15% and 50% relative improvements compared to CF-based methods and frequencybased method, respectively. As MPC does not use any personal information, it has the worst performance on recommendation.
PF+MPC does improve a lot from MPC due to the use of personal
log data. Furthermore, when we start to leverage the information
from similar users, there is another improvement observed in the
figure. Based on the performance from WRMF with all queries
and SVD, we can see that the weighted regularized scheme does
avoid imbalance issue in the OCCF problem. Moreover, leveraging more information in addition to the trending searches is helpful. Nevertheless, including more information from others queries
might sacrifice the accuracy of trending searches. This should not
happen because the trending searches are our suggestion targets.
Therefore, the TA-WRMF increases the error weights of trending
searches. The performance of TA-WRMF does confirm the observation with the improvement against others.
To further analyze the results, we separate the evaluations into
two conditions: 1) for each user ui , only the trending searches (qjt )
not issued in the training data , i.e., Ri,j = 0, are regarded relevant candidates (called non-issued relevant), as results shown in
Figure 4(B); and 2) conversely, for each user ui , only the queries
(qj ) issued in the training data, i.e., Ri,j = 1, are regarded relevant candidates (called issued relevant), as results shown in Figure
4(C). The objective is to deeply understand where the improvement
comes from. Although there is an interference between these two
conditions 9 , the results provide much information.

From Figure 4 (B)(C), we can see that if we just pull the issued
searches to the top, then the performance of issued relevant is the
best but the performance of non-issued relevant suffers severely,
even worse than MPC (general suggestion). On the other hand, the
CF-based models all outperform MPC on both conditions. This
demonstrates the information from neighborhood users does help.
While preferring the issued trending searches as PF does, the welllearned latent interests also have the ability to not only boost some
non-issued relevant trending searches but also filter out some noisy
issued trending searches. Among the CF-based models, SVD performs worse in both conditions due to imbalance of zeros. Thus, it
does not fit well for the issued searches and the non-issued relevant
are not boosted as well. WRMF (trending search only) might overfit the issued trending searches (qjt where Rij = 1), so the issued
relevant searches are not ranked high. WRMF (with all queries)
and IBCF have similar performance. They are both good on issued
relevant suggestion while overlooking the importance of trending
searches. Hence, the accuracy of issued relevant trending searches are sacrificed and the overall performance is dropped. Finally,
our proposed TA-WRMF achieves good performance for the issued
relevant trending searches, and at the same time, some non-issued
relevant trending searches are successfully ranked high. Therefore,
the performance of issued relevant condition is also competitive
10
. In short, TA-WRMF has competitive performances under both
conditions and thus has the best overall trending search suggestion
performance.

9

For example, if the ground truth contains a issued relevant and a nonissued relevant. If the issued relevant is ranked first, then the MAP upper
bound of the second condition is only 0.5.

10

The slightly shy numbers might be due to the interference between two
conditions.

performance would be degraded.

Qualitative Analysis. Figure 5 and Table 3 provide some qualitative analysis. Table 3 shows that the latent space of search queries
is quite meaningful by selecting some trending searches with their
5 nearest neighbors (NN) in the latent space. For example, “Katie
price wedding dress train” is surrounded by many other wedding
dress related queries. The neighbors “lichtenstein castle” are also
some landmarks, especially castles. Thus, it is reasonable to expect
the suggested trending searches are semantically consistent to user
interest.
Figure 5 shows more trending searches suggestions (top 20).
First, we can find some semantic consistency between personal
search logs and suggested results. For example, user #2 concerns
more about travel, related trending search, e.g., “neuschwanstein
castle,” is ranked very high. The issued relevant searches also
achieve good performance, e.g., “Barack Obama” and “lichtenstein
castle” for user #1 and user #2. Some issued relevant trending
searches are boosted according to the personal interest as some science related trending searches is suggested to the user #3 who has
generated plenty of science related queries.

6. CONCLUSIONS
To conclude, we have come up with a learning-based personalized trending image search suggestion framework, composed of
two stages. First, we propose the trending-aware weight regularized matrix factorization (TA-WRMF) to learn the user interest
by neighbor users with the help of auxiliary items, i.e., common
searches. Then, different features, including burstiness are investigated for representative image selection of trending search. By the
large-scale real commercial image search log, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of our personalized suggestion model and trendingaware image selection features.
In the future, we will improve the personalized trending image
search suggestion system in two-fold. First, we will leverage more
information source to detect trending searches. For example, it is
discovered that social media is able to shorten the trend detection
latency to about 4.5 hours [15]). Second, we are trying to perform
deeper understanding of the user. Long-term user preference (e.g.,
extending the training data to monthly scale) is aimed to be discovered to compensate the insufficiency of short-term interest learned.
Besides, it is also desired to mine and aggregate other information
such as user attributes or social networks for the cold-start users.

5.5 Evaluation of trending-aware representative image selection
Figure 6 shows the evaluation results of representative image selection by user study. All the invited subjects agree with the effectiveness of burstiness, which achieves the best performance among
all features. Figure 7 shows the example of representative image
selection. During the testing time (Nov. 2012), “Don Lemon,” an
anchor of CNN, was a trending search target as he had a Twitter
feud with “Jonah Hill,” a Hollywood star, as shown in Figure 7(E).
The relevance feature would pick the image with high popularity in
the past, but does not concern the burst nature, i.e., what crowd really desires to see during the period, as shown in Figure 7(B). The
visual consistency feature only considers the visual information,
and thus cannot capture the character as well, as shown in Figure
7(C). On the other hand, the burstiness feature is able to detect recency, and rank the related images to the top more successfully, as
shown in Figure 7(A).

We discuss the parameters in personalized trending search suggestion, including WP , WN (m = 1) in Eqn. (6). The sensitivity
test results can be seen in Figure 8 and 9. Figure 8 shows the results
of WP , i.e., the importance of positive pairs of user and trending
searches. The MAP reaches maximum when WP = 5. Figure 9
shows the sensitivity test results of WN , i.e., the weight of negative
pairs of user and search. Because of the imbalance issue, smaller
WN should be better as shown in the figure. WN = 0.1 reaches
the best MAP. However, when we keep lowering WN , the mod-
