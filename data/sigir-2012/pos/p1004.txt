ABSTRACT

bit flag. Hence, for each document and each occurring keyword, a
64-bit vector is used in ChatNoir’s approximate proximity feature.
The web interface of ChatNoir is similar to that of commercial
search engines (snippets, phrasal search, etc.). As for query processing, non-phrasal queries are handled by a 1-gram index of the
ClueWeb09 built with Hadoop. Phrasal queries are handled by a 2gram index and a 3-gram exact position index. For phrase queries
containing only 2-grams, the 2-gram index suffices. For phrase
queries with longer phrases, the 2-gram index is used to identify
documents that contain all 2-grams of a longer phrase while merging the postlists with the 3-gram positional index finally identifies the documents that contain the exact searched phrase. To ensure fast answer times, long queries with more than 2 keywords or
phrases are treated in a divide-and-conquer manner. The long query
is split into sub-queries for which a parallel retrieval is conducted.
The parallel results are then merged into just one list.
The ChatNoir engine runs on a cluster of 10 standard quad-core
PCs and 2 eight-core servers. It comes with a web interface and a
developer API at chatnoir.webis.de. This is the first public
alternative to Carnegie Mellon’s Indri search for reproducible experiments on the ClueWeb09 without the need of an own cluster
for indexing/searching. A load test with 100 000 unique queries
from a commercial search engine log showed the robustness and
scalability of ChatNoir. The first ten results are typically shown
within three seconds compared to more than ten seconds for an Indri search.

We present the ChatNoir search engine which indexes the entire
English part of the ClueWeb09 corpus. Besides Carnegie Mellon’s
Indri system, ChatNoir is the second publicly available search engine for this corpus. It implements the classic BM25F information retrieval model including PageRank and spam likelihood. The
search engine is scalable and returns the first results within three
seconds, which is significantly faster than Indri. A convenient API
allows for implementing reproducible experiments based on retrieving documents from the ClueWeb09 corpus. The search engine has
successfully accomplished a load test involving 100 000 queries.

INTRODUCTION

Many of the current TREC tracks and TREC style retrieval performance experiments are based on the ClueWeb09 corpus—a collection of 1 billion web pages crawled and provided by the Carnegie
Mellon University. As indexing and searching such a large corpus
requires a decent amount of hardware probably not available to all
researchers interested in TREC style experiments or TREC participation, a public search engine has been provided with the release of
the corpus.1 So far, this is the only publicly available search engine
for the ClueWeb09 and it has been used in many TREC runs over
the last years. However, the engine is rather slow (answer time of
about 10 seconds or more) and only offers the Indri retrieval model
(language modeling combined with an inference network). As an
alternative, we provide a faster public search engine—ChatNoir.

3. CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK
With our ChatNoir search engine we provide the second public
API for reproducibly searching the ClueWeb09 corpus in TREC
style experiments. ChatNoir’s much faster BM25F based search
offers an alternative to the available Indri retrieval model.
A first use case we are currently handling with ChatNoir is the
international PAN competition for automatic plagiarism detection.
Therefore, paid human individuals write short reports on TREC topics plagiarizing parts from ClueWeb09 documents found via ChatNoir searches. The competition participants are supposed to find
the most likely plagiarism sources also using ChatNoir.

CHATNOIR SEARCH

The ChatNoir search engine is based on the classic BM25F retrieval model [4] including the anchor text list provided by the University of Twente [3], the PageRank list provided by the Carnegie
Mellon University,2 and the spam rank list provided by the University of Waterloo [1]. ChatNoir also incorporates an approximate
proximity feature with variable width buckets as described by Elsayed et al. [2]. The text body of each document is divided into
64 buckets such that neighboring buckets have a half-bucket overlap. For each keyword, not the exact position is stored in a 1-gram
index but occurrence in the individual buckets is indicated via a
