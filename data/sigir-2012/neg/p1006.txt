H.3.1 [Information Systems]: Information Storage and
Retrieval—Content Analysis and Indexing

One entry point to our system is via our news search engine, which generates hyperlinks to the Entity Pages (EPs)
of entities appearing in displayed news articles. Users can
also select EPs by name or by browsing popular entities.
The left pane in Fig. 1 contains a picture and biographical
information from wikipedia. The right pane contains a set of
tabs that categorize nuggets by the information they convey.
The content in each tab is the output of statistical extraction
modules. The Figure shows two tabs – Related People and
Involvement in Events. The Related People nuggets are people names, and the Event ones describe events, like meetings
and talks. Nuggets are sorted by their relevance score. Each
nugget has a supporting passage where the evidence is highlighted in context. We also provide hyperlinks to other EPs
that appear in the passages. All tabs have graphical content
summaries like a network of related people or a word cloud.

EXTENDED ABSTRACT

This paper describes a live and scalable system that automatically extracts information nuggets for entities/topics
from a continuously updated corpus for effective exploration
and analysis. A nugget is a piece of semantic information
that (1) must be mapped semantically to the transitive closure of a pre-defined ontology, (2) is explicitly supported by
text, and (3) has a natural language description that completely conveys its semantic to a user. Fig. 1 shows a type
of nugget “involvement in events” for a person entity (Leon
Panetta): each nugget has a short description (“meeting”,
“news conference”) with a list of supporting passages.
Our key contributions are (1) We extract nuggets and remove redundancy to produce a summary of salient information with supporting clusters of passages. (2) We present
an entity/topic centric exploration interface that also allows
users to navigate to other entities involved in a nugget. (3)
We use the statistical NLP technologies developed over the
years in the ACE[6] ,GALE [5] and TAC-KBP[7] programs,
including parsing, mention detection, within and cross document coreference resolution, relation detection and slot filler
extraction. (4) Our system is flexible and easily adaptable
across domains as demonstrated on two corpora: generic
news and scientific papers. Search engines such as Google
News and Scholar[1, 2] do not retrieve nuggets, and only
remove redundancy at document level. News aggregation
applications such as Evri[3] categorize news articles based
on the entities of topics but do not extract nuggets. Other
systems extract richer information, but not all of it has clear
semantics; e.g., Silobreaker[4] presents results as “the relationship between X and Y in the context of [keyphrase]”,
leaving users with the task of interpreting the semantics as
it is not tied to a clear ontology. In contrast we remove redundancy, summarize results and present nuggets that have
clear semantics.

User Interface

Figure 1: Entity page for Leon Panetta
EPs for a collection of Scientific Papers have information
organized as co-Authors, Technology, Cited Papers, Authored
Papers. Unlike DBLP or Google Scholar we detect nuggets
for technology and software, etc.
