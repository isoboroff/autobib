ABSTRACT

and the questions they seek to answer [3, 10, 27]. As a result, there
is an increasing demand for tools to support exploration and analysis
of this data [32, 33]. Tools to support humanities researchers exist
but they are often not effective or remain unused [10, 34]. One
reason is that, generally, tools are developed without looking at
the context and complexity of the task [17]. Moreover, the level
of detail at which available models of the research cycle describe
search behavior is insufficient to design effective tools [32].
In this paper we start out by investigating the research cycle
of media studies researchers. Through an analysis of a series of
interviews about the research habits of media studies researchers we
arrive at a model of the media studies research cycle. We compare
our model to other models of the humanities research cycle, and
find that it is consistent with existing models [4, 9] but that it is
more detailed in identifying sequences of search processes and their
influence on the research question.

Media studies concerns the study of production, content, and/or
reception of various types of media. Today’s continuous production
and storage of media is changing the way media studies researchers
work and requires the development of new search models and tools.
We investigate the research cycle of media studies researchers and
find that it is an iterative process consisting of several search processes in which data is gathered and the research question is refined.
Changes in the research question, however, trigger new data gathering processes. Based on these outcomes we propose a subjunctive
exploratory search interface to support media studies researchers in
refining their research question in an earlier stage of their research.
To assess the subjunctive interface we conduct a user study and
compare to a traditional exploratory search interface. We find that
with the subjunctive interface users explore more diverse topics than
with the standard interface and that users formulate more specific
research questions. Although the subjunctive interface is more complex, this does not decrease its usability. These findings suggest that
the subjunctive interface supports media studies researchers. The
advantage of a subjunctive interface for exploration suggests a new
direction for the development of exploratory search systems.

INTRODUCTION

Media Studies can be situated both the humanities as well as in
the social sciences and concerns the study of production, content
and/or reception of various types of media, e.g., social media, film,
and television [23]. Today’s continuous production and storage of
all types of media is changing the way humanities researchers work

Figure 1 shows the phases in the media studies research cycle with
the associated search processes and changes in the research question. We find that the research cycle of media researchers is an
iterative process and that the research question is refined in each
step. Take for example the following initial research question: “How
are eastern European migrants represented on television,” and its
refinement: “How are children of USSR refugees represented in
television programs for children from 1980 to 2000.” Every change
in the research question, however, triggers new data gathering processes. Changing the research question comes at a cost as new data
has to be collected, organized and analyzed. We observe that factors
influencing the research question are discovering alternative views

on a topic and discovering trends in the data. These observations
suggest that an interface that supports these types of discovery in an
early stage of the research cycle will reduce the number of iterations
necessary to arrive at a final research question.
In this paper we focus on developing and assessing a search interface to support media studies researchers in refining their research
question in the exploration phase of the research cycle. Requirements for such an interface are that it supports (i) exploring multiple
views on a topic and (ii) discovering patterns in the data.
A number of exploratory search tools exist, that support various
ways to explore collections, e.g., through filtering by facets, or
relevance feedback, see [12, 29, 37] for overviews of systems and
their capabilities. As work on exploratory search systems focuses on
supporting exploration in a general setting, few have considered how
exploratory search systems can support researchers in discovering
alternative views and trends in the data during exploration. To
support users in complex search tasks [17], investigating multiple
aspects of a topic in a subjunctive interface was shown to reduce task
complexity and task completion time [24, 35]. In the humanities,
standard practices to discover patterns in data are organizing and
comparing [26, 28, 33].
We propose to extend the traditional exploratory search system
design in two ways: we incorporate two side-by-side versions of
an exploratory search interface in a single interface and second, we
add visualizations in which the characteristics of the result sets are
shown and can be compared. An interface that incorporates multiple
instances of the same search tool in a single interface is referred to
as a subjunctive interface [24]. Given this subjunctive exploratory
search interface we aim to answer the following research questions:
(i) does the subjunctive exploratory search interface better support
media studies researchers in a complex exploratory search task than
a standard exploratory search interface; (ii) does the subjunctive
exploratory search interface better support media studies researchers
in refining a research question than a standard exploratory search
interface; (iii) does the increase in complexity in terms of additional
features affect the usability of the subjunctive interface as compared
to a standard exploratory search interface?
In §2 we investigate the media studies research cycle. In §3 we
describe the subjunctive exploratory search interface and in §4 the
experimental design. In §5 we present the results of assessing the
subjunctive interface, and provide a discussion in §6. Related work
is discussed in §7 and we conclude in §8.

experienced in conducting interviews and a computer scientist with
some interview experience. The interviewers’ backgrounds supplement each other and limit the possibility of misunderstandings
during the interview. The subjects were recruited during visits to 3
institutes and participation was voluntary.
The interview was conducted in a semi-structured style and consisted of three parts: (i) identification of a recent research project;
(ii) open questions about search processes and research questions
during the project; and (iii) an interactive part in which subjects
wrote down the search processes on index cards and ordered them
chronologically. This methodology is based on [9]. Interviews
lasted about 30 minutes, were tape-recorded and later transcribed.
In our analysis of the interviews we used the following procedure:
first we align the search process sequences produced by each of the
interviewees by grouping cards with processes that exactly match
in the same category. Each card that does not match is placed in a
separate category. In the next step we apply coding, a qualitative
categorization strategy [31], to the transcripts to identify categories
of search processes in the interviews. Categories from the interviews
that match with existing categories in the sequences are merged
while newly identified categories are added to the sequences. This is
an iterative process which is repeated until a stable set of categories
emerges. The result is a sequence of categories showing the search
processes over time, see Figure 1. Note that when using quotes,
square brackets [..] indicate modifications to the original quote to
improve understanding or to protect the anonymity of the subject.
For identification purposes interviewees are assigned a number, i.e,
I1 to I7.

2.2

MEDIA STUDIES’ RESEARCH CYCLE

To develop an exploratory search tool to support media studies
researchers, it is necessary to gain insight into the user’s information
behavior and context of the task [16, 39]. Existing models of the
humanities research cycle or scholarly search behavior [2, 11, 19,
39] are either too general for building tools [32], do not consider the
context of increasing amounts of digital information [9], or focus
on a different aspect of the research cycle [4].
We take a detailed look at the research habits of media studies
researchers. We take a bottom-up approach and through a series
of interviews identify changes in the research questions and search
processes of media studies researchers during their research. We
construct a model of their research cycle and link this to existing
models of the humanities research cycle and information behavior.

2.1

Results

Three categories (phases) emerged from the analysis: exploration,
contextualization, and presentation. Each phase consists of a number
of search processes and affects the research question, see Figure 1.
Below we describe each category in detail.
Exploration. In general a research project starts with exploration.
All but one of the interviewees indicated that they started out with a
broad question. One already started with specific research questions
as these were defined in an earlier project (I6). With a broad question
in mind researchers start an exploratory search for literature, relevant
data or both. The goal of this phase is to arrive at an initial research
question and to collect a broad sample of data. One researcher noted
I1: “for me it starts with developing the research questions and data
collection. This happens in parallel, so the question changes by the
material you see” and another noted I2: “the data influences the
research question, because the data is not available or because you
start to see, oh this is so naïve.”
Once a selection of relevant data has been made the initial analysis
starts by organizing and structuring the collected material. This is a
time consuming process in which material is watched, transcribed,
and archived [28]. The goal is to get an overview and to formulate
an initial research question, leading to the next phase.
Contextualization. The contextualization phase is the most iterative part of the research cycle. The arrows are going back and forth
between analysis and data collection, and analysis and literature
study in Figure 1, indicate that multiple iterations may be performed.
In this phase a more focused data collection starts to place the initially collected material into context. We found various reasons for
researchers to repeat the data collection step: getting a representative
sample (I4: “so that [first analysis] was followed by collecting new
data, using the methods identified in the literature and guided by
insights from the earlier analysis”), getting context for a certain view
(I5: “I needed to know the ethnic background of people [mentioned
in tv-programs] for example”), and getting data to follow a new

Method

institutes with varying levels of experience: 1 PhD student, 4 postdoctoral researchers, 1 assistant-professor, and 1 full professor. Two

insight or direction (I3: “it was when I started having interviews
that I realized that it is not so black and white and that is when the
direction of my research changed completely”). These comments
illustrate how analysis of the data leads to collection of additional
data (I4, I5) and even completely new data (I3). These iterative
steps suggest that initially researchers do not have specific criteria
for data selection, only during analysis patterns emerge that lead to
more specific search criteria. These changes in the search criteria
manifest itself as a refinement in the research question.
After the new data has been collected another analysis follows,
where, again, the material is inspected and relations between material are identified. The research question is further refined and will
either lead to the next phase or another cycle of data collection and
analysis. One researcher notes I1: “by organizing [the material] you
create the story, I chose to use a chronological ordering, if I had
organized my archive differently I would have written a different
story. I could have organized it in supporters and opponents.” In
this case a certain view on the data was chosen and the data organized accordingly. The effort it takes to reorganize the data for a
certain view constrains the number of alternatives that are investigated, suggesting that having an overview of the alternatives early
in the research cycle can be beneficial. Another researcher states I2:
“and then you return again to the data and sometimes the literature,
while part of the data has already been collected, because you feel
that something is there but it does not come out.” In this case a
certain contrast was expected in the data but did not appear after
organization and analysis. This is another motivation for a more
thorough exploration of views on the topic before analysis.

researchers have been classified in four phases: getting an overview,
identifying boarderline exemplars, selection of specific programs
and verification of facts [23]. These changes in information needs
are consistent with our changes in the research question, but are
not considered in the context of a research cycle and the possible
repetition of information needs.
The relation of our model to search models [2, 11, 19], is that the
stages and features associated with these models are observed in the
media studies research cycle, but correspond to single processes, e.g.,
a data collection process. Our model describes the research cycle,
the context of these search processes. The information behavior
model by Wilson [39] provides a general framework to model users’
information behavior in context. We do not consider all possible
variables of the model as it is too broad. Instead, we focus on the
search processes (information seeking behavior) and the change of
the information need in the research cycle due to learning about
characteristics of the data (intervening variables).

2.4

Presentation. The interviewees agree that at some point the data
is fixed and the next phase starts. At this point a relevant sample
of the data has been collected and this data is interpreted in the
context of the refined research questions. This phase consists of
analyzing and writing as the media studies researcher builds up a
case to support his/her research questions by organizing the data
and selecting appropriate qualitative evidence. After the analyses
have been completed and the results have been written down, the
findings are disseminated in publications and at conferences.

2.3

Discussion

We find that the research cycle of media studies researchers is an
iterative process, where processes of data collection and analysis
alternate, see Figure 1. In the exploration phase an initial data set
is collected and analyzed. The analysis of data is an expensive
process that consists of extracting and organization of material, but
is necessary to get insight into the material and to refine the research
question. In the contextualization phase a new data collection process starts and another analysis follows. If this analysis reveals that
certain patterns or views on a topic have been missed the process
repeats. Otherwise a process of analysis, writing, and dissemination
follows, i.e., the presentation phase. Factors causing media studies
researchers to adjust their research question are discovering alternative views on a topic, and discovering trends in the data. These
observations suggest that an interface that supports these types of
discovery in an earlier stage of the research cycle will reduce the
number of iterations necessary to arrive at a final research question
and so support media studies research.

Relation to Other Models

A SUBJUNCTIVE INTERFACE

The model of the research cycle in §2 provides insight in the
requirements for a successful search interface for media studies
researchers. Below we describe the development process of our
subjunctive exploratory search interface, simply referred to as subjunctive interface in the remainder of the paper, followed by a
detailed description of the interface features.

We compare our model, as visualized in Figure 1, with previous work on describing the humanities research cycle. The model
of literary critics describes six stages: preparation, elaboration,
analysis and writing, dissemination, and further writing and dissemination [9]. The preparation stage corresponds with our exploration
phase. The elaboration, and the analysis and writing stage correspond to our contextualization phase. While the dissemination, and
further dissemination and writing stage corresponds to our presentation phase. That model, however, presents a cycle where all stages
are completed in sequence while we find a number of shorter cycles in the initial stages. The shorter cycles serve to find a focus
in the large amounts of available data. Another model proposes
three phases: reading and annotation, developing interpretation, and
presentation of interpretation [4], similar to our phases. The focus of
this work, however, is on note taking and organizing processes and
not on information seeking behavior. Additionally, we provide more
detail about the search processes in which media studies researchers
engage. There is work on describing the scholarly practices of humanities researchers [28], but while this work describes the possible
processes, e.g., organizing, it does not describe how these processes
influence the research questions during the research cycle. The
value of our model is that it makes the sequences of search processes and the gradual refinement of the research questions in the
media studies research cycle explicit. Information needs of media

Development Procedure

In developing the subjunctive interface care has been taken to
follow user centered design principles [5]. Here, we motivate the
initial design of the subjunctive interface, describe the data used in
our prototype, and findings from two rounds of usability testing.
Initial design. We established two requirements for an interface
for media studies researchers: (i) to provide users with support for
exploration, i.e., support in formulating queries, query refinement
and exploring various aspects of a topic; and (ii) to provide support
for discovering patterns in the data, i.e, to compare alternatives
and to observe trends in the data. A large body of work exists on
interfaces for supporting exploratory search [7, 8, 21, 29, 38, 40].
Such interfaces provide support for the first requirement through
visualizations, filters and facets. We start our interface development
with the design of a prototypical exploratory search interface [7].
Not as well supported by this type of interface is the ability to
compare alternatives. Subjunctive interfaces have been suggested
for this purpose as this type of interface allows a user to perform

427

multiple actions in parallel and compare the results, i.e., editing a
document or searching a database. Typically multiple versions of
a standard interface, e.g, a standard document editor, are presented
side-by-side to create a subjunctive interface [24]. In web search, a
multi-view interface has been proposed that supports multiple views
of a traditional web search interface and allows users to explore
more aspects of a topic than a single view variant [35]. Another
requirement not as well supported is the discovery of trends in
the data. Visualization laboratories, as those used in e-Science
disciplines, are better suited for this purpose as these offer various
visualization techniques, i.e., curves, scatter plots and renderings, to
analyse large numerical datasets [15].
Given our requirements, we adapted the standard exploratory
search interface design in two ways: (i) we extended the design
to a subjunctive exploratory search interface by incorporating two
side-by-side versions of a standard exploratory search interface;
and (ii) we added a timeline visualization and a term statistics
visualization in which the characteristics of the result sets obtained
with each side of the interface are shown and can be compared.

interface. We use the numbers (1, . . . , 10) in Figure 2 to reference
specific components in the interfaces.2
Baseline. The baseline interface consists of a search box (1), two
filters: a timeline (2) and a term-cloud filter (3), a timeline and
term statistics chart (4), and a result list (5). The baseline interface
provides traditional search functionality in that typing a query in
the search box (1) results in a ranked list of document snippets (5).
Each result snippet describes a program with a title, broadcast date,
and a maximum of 40 words from the summary of the program.
Next to each snippet, a bookmark button is available. Bookmarking
a program adds it to the query history, available as drop-down list,
showing for each query the programs bookmarked in its result set.
When clicking on a snippet an overlay with the complete program
description appears. In the result set 25 program snippets are shown
per page and the result set is limited to a maximum of 500 programs
to keep the interface responsive.
The filters (2, 3) enable a user to rapidly refine the result set
returned for a query [36]. Each subsequent filter that is applied
operates on the remaining program descriptions. Filters are reset by
issuing a new query or pressing a “clear filter” button. The timeline
filter removes programs with a broadcast date outside of the selected
range, see top Figure 3.
The term-cloud filter enables a type of faceted search over the
result set, see bottom Figure 3. Next to query refinement, faceted
search also provides support for gaining insight in a topic [20, 36].
We decided on five facets based on the focus group interviews:
people mentioned in a program, makers of a program, channel a
program is broadcasted on, words are keywords characterizing the

Data set. Television studies (a sub-discipline of media studies)
concerns the study of production and/or reception of television.
From an audiovisual archive we obtained a catalogue of about 1.5M
television program descriptions to serve as data set to be accessed
through our interface. We use descriptions as the actual programs are
often not directly accessible due to copyright legislation [23]. The
program descriptions are created by archivists, and primarily consist
of metadata fields describing the program. For example, keywords,
summary, and fields with program production information, e.g.,
broadcast date and program creator. The back-end of the interface
consists of a Lucene SOLR index, where stopwords have been
removed and stemming has been applied. For retrieval the Lucene
implementation of the Vector Space Model is used.1
Usability testing. In a first round of usability testing we presented
a prototype of the subjunctive interface to two groups of media
studies researchers, consisting of 12 and 16 subjects. A presentation
with a walk-through of the interface was followed by a group interview. The three main findings are: (i) the importance of production
information such as program broadcast date and program maker,
next to the content of programs; (ii) program genre information is
an essential subject in media studies; and (iii) television production/reception is often studied over time. We also received feature
requests, i.e, the ability to exclude certain terms, to view the query
history, and to load alternative archives such as news archives and
television magazine collections.
After a new round of development we performed a usability study
of the subjunctive interface. The subjects consisted of 30 first year
information science students that participated as part of a class
project. The main concerns of the subjects were with the cosmetics
of the interface, the response time, and the size of the result snippets.
After incorporating this feedback we performed a series of small
pilot studies with media studies researchers to test the final design
and to remove any further usability issues.

Subjunctive Interface Description

We start by describing an exploratory search interface that will
serve as the basis for the subjunctive interface. In the remainder of
the paper we refer to this interface as the baseline as it is used for
comparison in our evaluation of the subjunctive interface described
in §4. Figure 2 shows a schematic view of two interfaces: on the
left-hand side the baseline and on the right-hand side the subjunctive

accessed through a slide deck. The timeline chart, see Figure 4, is
shown by default. By clicking on the term statistics slide an animation shows the term statistics chart “sliding” over and covering
the timeline chart. The timeline chart is subsequently accessible
through the timeline slide. An example of the term statistics chart is
shown in Figure 5. A drop-down menu allows the user to select one
of the facets (people, maker, channel, words, and genre) to inspect
the terms that occur most frequently in the program descriptions.

left result set and one for its frequency in the right result set. The
terms are required to occur in both result sets and are ordered by the
total frequency in both sets, see Figure 7.
Note that although care has been taken in the design of the interface, we do not claim that this design is optimal. One suggestion
for improvement is a tabbed view allowing a user to operate any
number of instances of the interface and thus make any number
of comparisons. Another issue arises from the term-cloud tabs, although offering faceted search the facets are hidden and only one
facet is available at a time. Finally, we opted for cloud visualizations
which have been found to be inferior to alphabetical listings [14].
The current design however satisfies the essential requirements for a
subjunctive exploratory search interface and is suitable to answer
our research questions.

Subjunctive exploratory search interface. The left-hand side of
the subjunctive interface consists of the same features as the baseline
interface. On the right side the subjunctive interface further consists
of an additional search box (6), timeline and term-cloud filter (7,
8), and result list (10); see Figure 2. The two search boxes with
their respective filters and result lists are independent and in essence
provide the user with a second exploratory search interface. The
visualizations in the subjunctive interface (9) differ from those in
the baseline (4). The timeline chart shows two curves, one for each
result set, see Figure 6. The curves are color coded black and red.

Study procedure. Subjects were recruited by spreading a URL
among researchers and students at six media studies institutes. The
URL directed subjects to a webpage explaining the experiment.
Then subjects were presented with a consent form and a background
questionnaire. Next, a three minute tutorial video of the interface
was shown followed by a 3 minute practice session.
After practicing, subjects were given the following complex exploratory search task [17]: “As preparation for writing a research paper
on the topic of migrants you investigate an audiovisual repository.
You are interested in how migrants are represented on television.
The goal of exploring the repository is to help you establish the
initial research question for your paper.” Subjects were instructed
to bookmark programs deemed relevant to formulate their research
question and given 30 minutes to search for relevant programs with
one of the two interfaces. After 30 minutes, or when subjects pressed
a done button, a form was presented in which subjects were asked
to submit a research question. While formulating their research
question the subjects had access to the program descriptions bookmarked earlier during search. The final step consisted of a usability
questionnaire. A session took about 45 minutes per subject; as a
reward, subjects received a 10 Euro gift certificate.

tions we asked three media researchers, experts in the field of media
and migration, to act as assessors: an associate professor (judge1 ),
a full professor (judge2 ), and a post-doctoral researcher (judge3 ).
Research questions were judged on five criteria: (i) general quality
(g); (ii) extend to which a scope is defined, i.e., limiting the question
to a certain person or time (s); (iii) clarity of formulation (f); (iv) embedding (e), i.e., the degree in which the research question relates to
literature; and (v) originality (o). In the media studies research cycle
the refinement of the research question is a manifestation of changes
in data selection criteria. We therefore hypothesize that research
questions formulated by subjects with the subjunctive interface will
be judged higher on the scope criterion.
Usability. Exploratory search systems are more complex than
standard web search interfaces [36]. We introduce a subjunctive
version of an exploratory search interface that essentially doubles
the amount of features in the interface. We assess the subjunctive
interface in terms of usability and use the following criteria: (i) usefulness, (ii) intuitiveness; (iii) ease of use; and (iv) interestingness,
based on [22].
All judgements regarding the research questions and questions
in the exit-questionnaire are given on a five point Likert-type scale,
where the level of agreement is indicated in the range from one (not
at all) to five (extremely). When reporting results the Wilcoxon
ranksum test is used to determine significant differences between
groups at the α < .05 level. In tables significant differences are
always in comparison to the baseline and indicated in bold face.

Subjects. The interface is developed to support media studies
researchers, we therefore targeted subjects that had at least completed a Bachelor’s degree in media studies. Out of 61 subjects,
38 completed the experiment. Two subjects that did complete the
experiment were excluded from the experiment: one subject that
spent a total of 26 seconds interacting with the interface and one
subject that had not yet completed a Bachelor’s degree. This left
us with 36 subjects, 17 for the baseline and 19 for the subjunctive
interface.
In terms of research experience, subjects are from a wide range
of academic positions in media studies: 13 Master level students, 9
PhD students, 3 post doctoral researchers, 6 assistant professors, 1
full professor, and 4 research support staff. The research experience
of subjects, in terms of the median (MD) and interquartile range
(IQR), varies as subjects are a mix of researchers and students (MD
= 3, IQR = 0–6.5). We asked subjects background questions using
a 5 point Likert-type scale, where a one indicates no agreement
and a five indicates extreme agreement. Subjects generally reported
high levels of experience in general computer use (MD = 4, IQR =
4–5) and using online search tools (MD = 4, IQR = 4–5). Subjects
had little previous experience with the topic of the search task, e.g.,
media and migration (MD = 2, IQR = 1–3). We found no significant
differences between the groups in terms of these statistics.

RESULTS
Exploratory Search Support

To answer our first research question we evaluate the performance
of the baseline (bl) and subjunctive (sj) interface on a complex
exploratory search task in terms of user interaction statistics and in
terms of search patterns.
User interaction statistics. Our first hypothesis states that with
the subjunctive interface subjects will formulate more queries and
bookmark more diverse documents. We first compare subjects’
interactions with the baseline and subjunctive interface, followed by
an analysis of the diversity of the bookmarked documents.
Table 1 shows the medians (MD) and interquartile ranges (IQR),
for interactions of subjects with features of the two interfaces. We
find that the number of query formulations is higher for subjects
using the subjunctive interface (bl MD = 3, sj MD = 5). The difference is significant as indicated by a Wilcoxon ranksum test (W
= 255.5, p < .05) indicating that the subjunctive interface provides
more support for generating new query formulations. We observe
that subjects bookmark a similar number of documents with the
interfaces (bl MD = 9, sj MD = 9). The high-end of the interquartile

Evaluation Methodology

We assess the support the subjunctive interface provides for media
researchers in terms of three aspects: (i) support in exploration of
different views of a topic; (ii) support in refining a research question;
and (iii) general usability.
Exploration of different views. It is difficult to obtain a fixed set
of relevance judgements for a complex exploratory search task, e.g.,
gathering documents that serve as basis to formulate a research
question, as relevance is hard to determine in such a broad task [18].
Instead of using precision and recall, we evaluate support for exploration in terms of user interaction derived from server side log files.
We hypothesize that an interface that provides better support for exploratorion will enable subjects to generate more query formulations
and that subjects will bookmark more diverse documents.
Research question refinement. To evaluate subjects’ research ques-

430

range for the baseline is higher but the difference is not significant.
That subjects do not bookmark more documents may be due to the
task description, i.e., the goal is to formulate a research question
and not to bookmark as many relevant documents as possible.
The remaining interaction statistics demonstrate no apparent differences. We note that subjects spend a similar amount of time
searching (bl M = 532, sj M = 575), but that users of the subjunctive
interface spend more time operating the filters and/or analysing the
visualizations (bl = 303, sj = 384). While in the baseline interface
more time is spent inspecting results (bl = 254, sj = 202), i.e., reading result snippets and viewing documents. Although the difference
is not significant it is to be expected that subjects spend more time
analysing and filtering with the subjunctive interface as more information is presented. That subjects spent less time, or a similar
amount of time inspecting results is surprising as the subjunctive
interface presents twice as many results. We look further into this
when analysing the interaction patterns.
Next we investigate whether there are differences in the diversity
of bookmarked documents. We use cosine similarity as a distance
measure and calculate the average pairwise cosine similarity of the
documents bookmarked (Ds ) by a subject (s):
P
avg_sim(s) = |P1s | (d,d0 )∈Ps sim(d, d0 ),

earlier finding, see Table 1, that the subjunctive interface provides
more support for formulating new queries.
When starting with a filtering action and then inspecting the
results (FI) subjects using the subjunctive interface tend to transition
more from filtering actions to bookmarking or viewing documents
(bl FIFI = 30, sj FIFI = 55). With the subjunctive interface subjects
spend more time refining and inspecting result snippets (sj FIFIFI =
29); the number of times a filter and inspection sequence leads to a
bookmark is comparable (bl FIB = 25, sj FIB = 23). The extra time
spent refining and inspecting can be explained by the presence of
the second result set in the subjunctive interface as subjects have a
larger set of program descriptions at their disposal.
In the baseline interface a bookmark action is often followed by
moving to the next result page (bl BP = 15) and (bl BPBP = 8),
while in the subjunctive interface more often program descriptions
are viewed (sj BD = 18). This suggests that subjects using the
baseline interface are unable to formulate new queries or use filters
to refine the result set and resort to browsing more result pages
in the result set. This is consistent with the observation in the
interaction statistics, see Table 1, that with the baseline more time
is spent inspecting results; this is similar to the behavior observed
in web search when users face a difficult search task [1]. Users
of the subjunctive interface on the other hand, tend to bookmark
documents on the first result page (sj BIB = 8 ) and (sj BDB = 11).
We have determined that there are differences in the interaction
patterns of subjects using the baseline and subjunctive interface.
Interaction patterns show that with the subjunctive interface subjects
alternate more between formulating queries and inspecting results
than subjects using the baseline interface. We also find that users of
the baseline are more often unable to refine their information need
and resort to an exhaustive search of the results.

here Ps is the set of pairs of documents bookmarked by a subject:
Ps = {(d, d0 ) : d, d0 ∈ Ds , d 6= d0 } and sim(d, d0 ) is defined as:
sim(d, d0 ) = √Pn

#

.

The average similarities for subjects using the baseline (avg_sim
MD = .62, IQR = .56–.69) are higher than the similarities of subjects
using the subjunctive interface (avg_sim MD = .52, IQR = .43–.63 )
and this difference is significant (W = 195 p = .05). That documents
bookmarked with the subjunctive interface are less similar than those
bookmarked with the baseline indicates that with the subjunctive
interface a more diverse set of documents are explored.
User interaction patterns. The interaction statistics suggest that the
subjunctive interface provides more support for exploration than the
baseline, if so we would expect to find differences in subjects’ search
behavior. We first describe the process of creating the interaction
patterns based on maximal repeating patterns [30] and then analyze
the patterns generated with the two interfaces.
An interaction pattern consists of all of a subject’s search actions
during a search session. We identify the following action types:
submitting queries (Q), using filters (F), inspecting results (I), bookmarking (B), viewing program descriptions (D), paginating to new
result pages (P), and closing the interface (S). Repeated actions are
aggregated into a single action type, e.g., queries submitted in the
left or right search box of the subjunctive interface are considered as
a single query (Q) action. The purpose of the resulting interaction
pattern is to reveal transitions between interaction types. Per subject
group all occurrences of possible sub-patterns of at least two subsequent actions are counted to find the maximal repeated patterns
(MRP) for each interface. For example, the sequence of actions:
QFIFIQFI, contains the following MRP: QFI and FI, as these are
the longest sequences that are repeated.
Table 2 shows the top 8 MRPs that start with a query action (Q),
a filter action (F), or a bookmark action (B). In both interfaces the
most frequent transition after submitting a query is to inspect the
results (bl QI = 37, sj QI = 57). After this initial behavior, subjects
using the subjunctive interface more often reformulate their query
(bl QIQ = 12, sj QIQ = 22), while users of the baseline prefer
filtering (bl QIF = 15, sj QIF = 13). This is consistent with the

Research Question Formulation Support

To address our second research question we evaluate how the
exploration provided by the two interfaces affects the research questions formulated by the subjects. We perform two types of evaluation: (i) a quantitative evaluation where we use explicit judgements
of the research questions; and (ii) a qualitative analysis where we
divide research questions into phrases and classify these into several
types to compare the composition of the research questions.
Research question formulation performance. Our second hypothesis states that research questions formulated by subjects with the
subjunctive interface will be judged higher on the scope criterion.

the scope criterion. We observe that when subjects use the baseline,
questions are based on observations of trends in the timeline, i.e., the
increase and decrease in the occurrence of a query term in programs.
This leads to research questions that focus on a single topic during a
certain period, i.e., the representation of the Islam (bl rq1 ) and the
representation of a political figure (bl rq2 ). The ability to compare
changes in frequency of query terms on a timeline in the subjunctive interface, however, inspires subjects to consider more views.
This leads to research questions that include interactions between
multiple aspects of a topic, e.g., representation of Muslims and the
influence of terrorism (sj rq1 ) and difference in representation of
refugees’ children in fictional programs compared to documentaries.
In the last research questions (bl and sj rq3 ) the effect of the subjunctive interface is most obvious. Although both questions follow the
change in use of terminology over time, in the subjunctive interface
a contrast is made between two terms.

the judgements of the research questions on the five criteria, i.e,
general quality (g), scope (s), formulation (f), embedding (e), and
originality (o), by three media researchers. Overall agreement of
the assessors on the criteria is low as indicated by Fleiss’ Kappa
(κ < .2). Agreement is stronger on the scope criterion (κ = .2362).
Subjects’ research questions are judged to be good in terms of
quality, formulation, and originality, for all three assessors (MD
≥ 3). The level of embedding is lower (MD ≤ 3), as researchers
were unable to consult any literature during the experiment. The
judgements for the scope of the research questions, are mixed. We
observe, however, no apparent differences between the baseline and
subjunctive interface for the judgement criteria.
That we observe no differences may be due to the open ended nature of the task of formulating a research question and the difficulty
of judging research questions without any further context.

5.3

Usability

To answer our third research question we look at the usability of
the interfaces. Table 6 shows the medians and interquartile ranges of
subjects’ judgements of the usability of the two interfaces. Subjects
indicate that both are intuitive (bl = 4, sj = 4) and that they are
not difficult to use (bl = 2, sj = 2). Of the subjects, 75% do not
find the subjunctive interface difficult to use (difficult ≤ 3). This
suggests that subjunctivity can be added to exploratory interfaces
with little cost to the difficulty and intuitiveness of the system. We
further asked subjects if the interfaces were interesting to use and
useful for media research. Subjects indicate that both interfaces are
interesting (bl = 4, sj = 4) and useful, in case of the subjunctive
interface subjects indicate it to be extremely useful (bl = 4, sj = 5).
Regarding the visualizations subjects indicate a preference for the
timeline chart. We suspect that the information in the term statistics
chart is more difficult to interpret and therefore used less.

Research question composition. The research questions formulated by the media studies researchers provide a rich source of
qualitative data. To investigate if there is a difference in the views
and topics of the research questions, we perform a qualitative analysis of the phrases that define the scope in the research questions
of the 36 subjects. We identify five types of phrases: defining (i) a
program genre; (ii) a group to study; (iii) a focus on a theme or
person; (iv) a time period; or (v) a part of the program production
process.
Table 4 shows the number of occurrences of types of phrases that
determine the scope of a research question. A similar number of
phrases of type genre, period, and production is found in research
questions generated with the baseline and subjunctive interface.
There is a difference in the number of phrases of type group (bl =
14, sj = 17), but not in terms of unique phrases. Here, the phrase
“migrants” is used to specify the population of study, most likely
influenced by the use of the term in the search task. We observe
that in research questions generated with the subjunctive interface
more often phrases that describe a specific theme occur as compared
to the baseline (bl = 8, sj = 12) and in most cases these themes
are unique (bl = 7, sj = 11). This suggests that the subjunctive
interface provides subjects with more support to explore different
themes surrounding a topic and that they use this information to
scope their research question. There is little influence on other types
that determine the scope of a research question, e.g., a time period
or television genre, as both interfaces provide users with the ability
to spot trends through the timeline and term statistics chart.
Next we provide an example-based comparison to further illustrate the effect of the interfaces on the scope of the research questions. Table 5 shows the top 3 research questions for the baseline and
subjunctive interface at the top and bottom respectively. Questions
are ranked in terms of the sum of the three assessors’ judgements on

DISCUSSION

Regarding our first research question, we find significant evidence
that with the subjunctive interface, media studies researchers exhibit different search behavior than with the baseline interface on
a complex exploratory search task. Subjects are able to formulate
more queries and bookmark more diverse documents than with a
traditional exploratory search interface. Inspection of the interaction
patterns confirms these findings. Users of the subjunctive interface
follow a pattern of reformulating a query and inspecting results followed by another query reformulation and result inspection, while
users of the traditional exploratory search interface formulate less
queries and look through more result pages.

the use of the term immigrant. Is it possible to identify a cause in the broadcasting
schedule of that time? Are there specific programs that started this development?

With regard to our second research question, we find that with
both interfaces researcher are able to formulate high quality research
questions. A qualitative analysis of the research questions shows that
there is a difference in the research questions that subjects formulate.
With the subjunctive interface subjects use more diverse themes
to scope their research question. There is no influence on other
types of defining the scope, e.g., a time period, as both interfaces
provide users with the ability to spot trends in visualizations. An
example based comparison of the top 3 research questions in terms
of scope illustrates the difference in the number of views on a topic
incorporated in the research questions.
Turning to the third research question, we find that although the
complexity of the subjunctive interface in terms of features almost
doubled compared to the standard exploratory search interface, most
users indicate that the subjunctive interface is intuitive and not
difficult to use. Users indicate that the subjunctive interface is
interesting and judge it to be extremely useful for media research.
The subjunctive interface was developed to support the exploration phase in the media studies research cycle by supporting multiple views on a topic and discovering trends in the data. The above
findings demonstrate that a subjunctive exploratory search interface
can indeed provide this type of support for media studies research.
A limitation of this study is that the time and data restrictions in the
experiment make it an abstraction from the real research cycle; a
longitudinal study where the subjunctive interface is used by media
studies researches will have to be conducted. Another limitation is
that the study of the research cycle is based on a small number of
interviews. The development of the subjunctive interface, however,
has been done in close co-operation with media studies researchers.
Therefore the model and the ideas on which the subjunctive interface
has been based, have repeatedly been under close examination from
the targeted end users, thereby strengthening its foundation.

to support insight generation. The Google ngram viewer is a tool
that enables comparison of trends in term occurrences on a timeline
in a large book collection supporting cultural analytics [27]. A
limitation of these tools is the lack of support for exploration of
different subsets of documents, e.g., query result sets.
Subjunctive interfaces have been proposed in a more general
setting [24], e.g., to compare two documents in a side-by-side editor.
For web search an interface with multiple views of a traditional
web search interface was shown to be effective to support complex
search tasks [35]. We extend this body of work by investigating the
value of multiple views in a exploratory search interface.

CONCLUSION

In this paper we have presented a subjunctive exploratory search
interface to support media studies research. By analysing the media
studies research cycle we have found that media studies researchers
require support in discovering multiple views on a topic and discovering trends in data to refine their research question in an earlier
stage of the research cycle. We have developed a subjunctive exploratory search interface and performed a user study to assess its
value for media studies researchers. We have found that with the
subjunctive interface media studies researchers are able to formulate
more queries and bookmark more diverse documents compared to
a standard exploratory search interface. In a qualitative analysis of
the research questions formulated by media studies researchers we
have found evidence to suggest that the influence of the subjunctive
interface is predominantly on the scope of the research question.
Specificly, users of the subjunctive interface incorporate more views
on a topic in their research question than users of the standard exploratory search interface. We have observed no advantage for other
types of defining the scope as visualizations in both interfaces enable spotting trends in the data. In terms of usability, media studies
researchers report that the subjunctive interface is intuitive and not
difficult to use, suggesting that the additional complexity in terms
of features in the subjunctive interface does not reduce its usability.
These findings are important for media studies, but also have further
implications. The continuous increase in data and its effect on the
importance of exploration in the research cycle indicates a need
to study this effect in other areas of the humanities. Additionally,
with respect to exploratory search, the support provided by the subjunctive interface for exploration suggests a new direction for the
development of exploratory search systems. In future work we plan
to launch the subjunctive interface at a television archive to assess
its value for media studies in a longitudinal study.

RELATED WORK

The work in this paper touches on various areas of research and
we briefly highlight related work. Many specific related publications have already been cited earlier in the paper. We complement
this with a brief and slightly more general discussion. As to exploratory search [25], many exploratory search tools have been
suggested [6–8, 12, 13, 21, 29, 38, 40] which served as inspiration
in the development of our interface.
Tools in the humanities exist for the analysis of data once it has
been collected. Some of the more recent projects are: MONK3 a
data analysis laboratory that provides visualizations and data mining
tools; TaPoR4 an indexing and search tool to locate co-occuring
phrases in texts; and Pliney [4] a tool for note taking and organizing
