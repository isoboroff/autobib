accomplish a task, at a given point in time and space, and
this “context” can be used to aid query understanding.
Traditionally search engines have returned the same
results to everyone who asks the same question. However,
using a single ranking for everyone, in every context
limits how well a search engine can do. In this talk I
outline a framework to quantify the “potential for
personalization”, that can be used to characterize the
extent to which different people have the same (or
different) intents for a query. I then describe several
examples of how we represent and use different kinds of
context to improve search quality. Finally I conclude by
highlighting some important challenges in developing
such systems at Web scale including system optimization,
evaluation, transparency and serendipity.

ABSTRACT
It is very challenging task to understand a short query,
especially if that query is considered in isolation.
Luckily, queries do magically appear in a search box –
rather, they are issued by real people, trying to
