ABSTRACT

derstanding of tweets and social graphs of microblog users.
Instead, we explore the use of historic tweets with similar
static and dynamic characteristics for prediction. After a
tweet is posted, we collect its retweeting amount within the
ﬁrst one hour. If the amount is greater than a certain threshold (say 100), it is regarded as a popular tweet, and we then
formulate its retweeting amounts at diﬀerent time intervals
of the ﬁrst one hour into a time series. We identify a set of
historic tweets with the same author and post time (at the
granularity of hour), and ﬁnd from them the top-k tweets
with similar retweeting patterns. The mean lifespan of the
top-k tweets is computed as the estimated lifespan of the
new tweet. We evaluate our method on the real data set
from Tencent Microblog, which has the largest number of
users (over 200 millions) in China. The experimental results
show our approach outperforms the baseline approaches.

In microblog like Twitter, popular tweets are usually retweeted by many users. For diﬀerent tweets, their lifespans (i.e.,
how long they will stay popular) vary. This paper presents
a simple yet eﬀective approach to predict the lifespans of
popular tweets based on their static characteristics and dynamic retweeting patterns. For a potentially popular tweet,
we generate a time series based on its ﬁrst-hour retweeting
information, and compare it with those of historic tweets of the same author and post time (at the granularity of
hour). The top-k historic tweets are identiﬁed, whose mean
lifespan is estimated as the lifespan of the new tweet. Our
experiments on a three-month real data set from Tencent
Microblog demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of the approach.

2. PROBLEM AND SOLUTION
To predict the lifespans of popular tweets, we ﬁrst deﬁne
the notions of popular tweets and lifespan based on the following observations. We investigated a two-month collection
of tweets in 2011 and observe that

INTRODUCTION

• after a tweet is posted, its retweeting amount at the
beginning hours reﬂects whether the tweet is popular
or not within the next few days.

Nowadays, microblog has become one of the most popular
social network services, used by billions of people all over the
world. In microblog, popular information usually spreads
incredibly rapidly through users’ retweeting behaviors. Predicting tweets’ popularity is desirable for a large scope of
applications like burst events detection, microblog advertisement and real-time recommendation, etc. Such popularity
prediction involves two issues: 1) how popular a tweet will
be (i.e., popularity degree) and 2) how long a tweet will stay popular (i.e., popularity lifespan). A bundle of research
has recently been carried on to address the ﬁrst issue. Hong
et al. [2] predicted tweets’ popularity using a classiﬁcation
method. Cui et al. [1] proposed an HF-NMF approach to
predict how many friends of a user in a Facebook-like social
network service would share the same content as the user
forwarded.
This paper examines the second issue, aiming to predict lifespans of tweets in microblog. To our knowledge, this
is the ﬁrst attempt in the literature to address the prediction problem of tweets’ lifespans. Diﬀerent from traditional
microblog analysis methods, we do not focus on semantic un-

• almost 100% of tweets are rarely retweeted after 72
hours since they are posted. In other words, the retweeting amount of tweets almost achieves the maximum
within the ﬁrst 72 hours after posted.
Definition 1. A tweet is a popular tweet if its retweeting amount within the ﬁrst 1 hour is no less than a certain
threshold.
Definition 2. For a popular tweet, its lifespan is the hours
that have passed when its retweeting amount reaches 95%
of the total retweeting amount. In this study, the retweeting amount in 72 hours is approximately taken as the total
retweeting amount.
For a popular tweet, we predict its lifespan based on historic tweets with similar characteristics.
First, candidate tweets with similar static characteristics
are identiﬁed. Two aspects are considered in the study. 1)
Post time of the tweet. The time when a tweet is posted
impacts its retweeting pattern. For example, the retweeting
pattern of a tweet posted at 5 am is diﬀerent from that

posted at 5 pm. 2) Author of the tweet. Diﬀerent microblog
users have diﬀerent followers with diverse characteristics in
terms of retweeting behavior, active involvement, follower
composition, interest, etc. We gather historic tweets with
the same author and post time as the one to be predicted.
Second, top-k historic tweets are found from the candidate tweet set based on the similar dynamic retweeting
pattern. To do that, we partition the ﬁrst one hour into N number of equal time intervals, where N = 2n + 1
(n = 0, 1, . . .). We then count the retweeting amount of
the tweet during each time interval. The tweet’s retweeting amounts at consecutively diﬀerent time intervals thus
formulate a time series RT S = RC1 , RC2 , . . . , RCN .
The distance between two time series is deﬁned as the Euclidian distance:

considers similar post time and retweeting pattern. Table
1 shows the prediction performance in RMSE by diﬀerent
methods.

We evaluated our lifespan prediction approach on the real
data set from Tencent Microblog. We collected the retweeting information of all the tweets from October 1, 2011 to
December 31, 2011, and ﬁltered out potentially unpopular
tweets whose ﬁrst-hour retweeting amounts are less than
100. We took the tweets of the ﬁrst two months, total
229666, as the historic tweet set, and the tweets of the third
month, total 118471, as the test set.
The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE ) is used as the
evaluation metric. The smaller RMSE is, the better the
performance is. Let X be the total number of tweets for
prediction, Lif eSpanp (Ti ) and Lif eSpant (Ti ) be the predicted and 
real lifespan of the i-th tweet.

Note that inﬂuential time intervals with more contribution
to the similarity could be picked up and enforced with different weights here. For instance, we could pick up the ﬁrst,
middle, and last time intervals of RT S, RC1 , RCn , RC2n+1 ,
to characterize the retweeting trend of the tweet.
Third, after obtaining the top-k similar historic tweets
{T1 , T2 , . . . , Tk }, their mean lifespan is calculated as the estimated lifespan of the tweet to be predicted:

From Table 1, three conclusions can be made. 1) The
proposed ATR-kNN approach outperforms the baseline algorithms (kNN, SVR and LR), achieving the best performance under diﬀerent fhrc values. 2) The two static characteristics emphasized in our approach do contribute to the
prediction performance, and the author requirement plays
a more important role than the post time of the tweets. 3)
The more the fhrc is, the better performance our approach
achieves. This demonstrates that our approach is eﬀective
to deal with popular tweets.

The value of k is set to 5, because our experiments show
that the improvement is not obvious when k is over 5. fhrc
(first-hour retweeting count) is the retweeting amount
of a tweet during the ﬁrst hour after it is posted.
The Q-Q plot [3] of the predicted lifespan and real lifespan
is shown in Fig.1. As illustrated in Fig.1, the distribution
of predicted lifespan matches that of the real lifespan well,
especially when the lifespan lasts for 20-40 hours. Due to
the insuﬃcient number of historic tweets and the average
method, the predicted value is less than the real one for
tweets with over 50-hour lifespan in the data set, which will
be considered in our future work.
We further compare our approach with three baseline algorithms, which are kNN (k-Nearest Neighbors), SVR (Support Vector Regression), and LR (Linear Regression). ATRkNN approach considers identical author, similar post time
and retweeting pattern, AR-kNN approach considers identical author and retweeting pattern, and TR-kNN approach
