Click logs from search engines provide a rich opportunity
to acquire implicit feedback from users. Patterns derived
from the time between a posted query and a click provide
information on the ranking quality, reflecting the perceived
relevance of a retrieved URL. This paper applies the KaplanMeier estimator to study click patterns. The visualization
of click curves demonstrates the interaction between the relevance and the rank position of URLs. The observed results
demonstrate the potential of using click curves to predict
the quality of the top-ranked results.

INTRODUCTION AND DATASET

Ranking is a major concern to information retrieval applications such as document ranking on search engines. Implicit feedback from click logs can be used to approximate
relevance judgements and improve rank results [7, 5]. This
paper adopts Kaplan-Meier survival analysis [8] to examine
clicking patterns, accounting for relevance labels and rank
position of the URLs on a search engine result page (SERP).
In medical research, the Kaplan-Meier estimator approximates the survival function, measuring the probability of
patients surviving for different time points after treatment.
We use the estimator to create click curves, showing the
probability of URLs remaining unclicked across time. In
both cases, the data is often right-censored, i.e. final outcomes are not observed for some instances. In click logs,
censoring occurs when a search session ends or a query is
replaced by the succeeding query. Figure 1(a) illustrates the
definitions for clicked and censored time in one session. Click
times are derived from the immediately previous query, and
censored times include the time from the first QA to QB ,
and from second QA to the end of the session.
The visualization of click curves can show the interaction
between relevance and position bias, making the knowledge
of clicks more explicit. We expect that if a search engine
returns a relevant URL on top of the ranked list, its click

curve will drop drastically at the beginning and eventually
approach zero, e.g., in Figure 1(b), URL 3808 is relevant to
Query 5771. Our goal is to quantify and visualize the effects
of relevance and ranking on the probability and speed of user
clicks. To our knowledge, this is the first work that applying
survival analysis to study click patterns.
We use the Yandex click log dataset provided by the Relevance Prediction Challenge and Workshop on Web Search
Click Data (WSCD 2012). The goal of the challenge is to
rank URLs by relevance based on user search behavior. The
click log is grouped by sessions, containing query IDs, ranked
URLs from the Yandex SERP for each query, and a sequence
of click actions. Yandex assigned binary labels (“relevant”
and “not relevant”) to a subset of URLs appearing in the log.
There are 5,191 unique queries in the original training set.
We selected Query 5771 (Q5771), Query 222491 (Q222491),
to test our approach. Q5771 and Q222491 each have 3468
and 2179 unique sessions, and have 14 and 13 judged URLs.
As shown in Table 1, Q5771 has stronger performance in
ranking than Query 222491. The top 10 ranked list in the
table is sorted by the average rank for each labeled URLs
displayed on SERP, showing the overall performance for the
two queries. However, the top 10 URLs in actual session
logs can be different from the table.

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

Position bias is a primary concern in click logs. The probability of a click depends not only on its relevance, but on
its position in the results page. Several papers formalized
position bias using probabilistic models, such as the Cascade model [2], dynamic Bayseian network click model [1],
Click Chain model [6], and user browsing model [3]. Unlike these models, we incorporate the time from a query to
a click to model and visualize the unclicked probability of
URLs. We believe that although top-ranked URLs may be
clicked faster, a lower ranked but relevant URL may still
be quickly discovered and clicked. The proposed click curve
analysis exhibits distinct patterns between groups with various combinations of relevance and rank positions.
Although the time to first click was considered by Fox et
al. [4], opportunities remain for exploring the use of activity time as a source of implicit feedback to judge the relevance of search results [5]. Compared to [4], we expand
the scope from time to first click to time to all clicks. We
adopted survival analysis to examine click patters in click
logs, investigating the inter-related effect of relevance and
rank positions.
This paper demonstrates the potential of applying survival
analysis to determine the quality of ranked results. Visualizing click curves helps understand the interaction between the
rank positions and the relevance of the retrieved URLs. The
proposed approach can also be personalized to model individual users. Future work can focus on deriving functions for
click curves to predict relevance labels for individual URLs.
Click curves can also be included as an informative feature
for learning to rank.

Figure 2(e) and 2(f) explore the effect of position bias on
click curves at the position 1 to 5. As the ranked results
are ideal for Q5771, we observed distinct clicking patterns
on the top 5 results for Q5771 in Figure 2(e). Figure 2(f)
shows a sharp drop on rank 5, implying the URL at rank
5 is more relevant than URLs at rank 2 and 3, which are
judged not relevant to the query.

URLs by rank and relevance. Log-rank tests (p = 0.05) were
performed on all pairs of curves.
Both Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show significantly different
clicking patterns for URLs in the top 5 on the SERP. However, the distance between the two curves diminishes as more
relevant URLs were ranked lower for Q222491. The results
indicate that the effect of position bias may vary among
queries. To further study the interaction between relevance
and rank, we divide URLs into four groups as shown in Figure 2(c) and 2(d). Group 1 contains relevant URLs ranked
in the top 5; Group 2, relevant URLs in bottom 5; Group 3,
irrelevant URLs in top 5; Group 4, irrelevant URLs in bottom 5. The pair-wise tests on groups are significant except
in two cases: between Group 2 and 4 for Q222491, and between Group 1 and 3 for Q5771. Figure 2(c) indicates that
the irrelevant URLs mixed in the top 5 can become hard to
discover as Q5771 has evident position bias. On the other
hand, since Q222491 has better ranking at the bottom, the
differences between Group 2 and 4 diminish. In Figure 2(d),
since the ranking on the top 5 for Query 222491 is imperfect,
the click patterns for relevant and irrelevant URLs are distinct. Moreover, both Figure 2(c) and 2(d) show that, even
given the position bias, the click curve for relevant URLs
