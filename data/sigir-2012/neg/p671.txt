ABSTRACT

for a given user by referencing item ratings from other similar users, while content-based ﬁltering techniques [23] make
recommendations by matching a user’s personal interests (or
proﬁles) with item content (e.g., item description or tags).
Recent development of social media and social networking
systems brings new opportunities for recommender systems.
Several research works ﬁnd that there is a correlation between items selected by a user and those selected by her
friends (i.e., friends share some common interests) and propose to exploit the correlation for item recommendations [12,
16, 17, 18, 19, 6]. The basic idea behind these techniques
is that, since a user’s friends may share common interests,
recommendations can be made to the user by considering interests of her friends. For example, [32] makes recommendations by assigning weights to friends based on the similarity
of item selection behavior (in terms of the number of commonly selected items) and similarity of social friendship (in
terms of the number of their common friends). In addition,
[12, 16] employ the random walk approach [30] to incorporate user’s social relationship in item recommendation. This
approach fundamentally assumes that friends exhibit similar
behavior and thus aims to incorporate the friendship into the
random walking process. However, due to the lack of quantiﬁed strength in friendship, equal weights have been assigned
to social links from a user to her friends. This uniform weight
assignment obviously does not truthfully capture the role of
friendship played in the item selection process and thus is
not expected to be eﬀective for recommendations.
Some prior works avoid the aforementioned problem by
integrating users’ social trust network into their recommendation techniques. Assuming that trust intensities among
users and their friends are handily available and that users
and friends exhibit similar behaviors, the trust intensities
among friends are used as the basis to assign more similarity
weight to trusted friends when making recommendations [17,
18]. In [19], the authors learn a user’s preference from the
aggregated preferences of her friends. More speciﬁcally, they
add additional regularization term in the matrix factorization approach to impose the constraints that user’s latent
topic vector should be similar to the average or weighted
average of her friends’ latent topic vectors. Recently, [6]
explores a notion of social correlation to capture the correlation/similarity in the item selection behavior of social
friends, i.e., two friends with very similar item selection behavior have very high social correlation. The authors adopt
latent factor model to learn the social correlation among
friends from their social network and a user-item accessing
matrix. Experimental result shows that social correlation is
able to improve recommendation performance.
All of the above mentioned research works obtained varied performance improvement over conventional item recommendation techniques, demonstrating the advantages taking the social friendship in item recommendation. It’s not

Social friendship has been shown beneﬁcial for item recommendation for years. However, existing approaches mostly
incorporate social friendship into recommender systems by
heuristics. In this paper, we argue that social influence between friends can be captured quantitatively and propose
a probabilistic generative model, called social influenced selection(SIS), to model the decision making of item selection
(e.g., what book to buy or where to dine). Based on SIS, we
mine the social inﬂuence between linked friends and the personal preferences of users through statistical inference. To
address the challenges arising from multiple layers of hidden
factors in SIS, we develop a new parameter learning algorithm based on expectation maximization (EM). Moreover,
we show that the mined social inﬂuence and user preferences
are valuable for group recommendation and viral marketing.
Finally, we conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation
using real datasets crawled from last.fm and whrrl.com to
validate our proposal. Experimental results show that social inﬂuence captured based on our SIS model is eﬀective
for enhancing both item recommendation and group recommendation, essential for viral marketing, and useful for
various user analysis.

INTRODUCTION

Recommendation systems have attracted a lot of attention in the past decade and have been successfully deployed
in many e-commerce websites, such as Amazon and Netﬂix. Two widely adopted approaches for recommendation
systems are collaborative ﬁltering (CF) and content-based
ﬁltering [1]. Collaborative ﬁltering [4, 9] recommends items

which mandates development of a new and eﬃcient learning
algorithm. Assuming that the social inﬂuence exists only
between friends instead of arbitrary users, we address the
scalability issue by devising a new model learning algorithm
which handles two layers of latent variables at the same time.
In addition, to explore the ﬂexibility and applicability of SIS,
we explore the social inﬂuence and user preferences mined
based on SIS for group recommendation, viral marketing
and various user analysis. The primary contributions made
in our research are summarized as follows.

surprising that recommendation techniques that exploit the
similar item selection behavior of friends have achieved a
certain degree of success, as several research studies on social network analysis have indicated that a user’s behavior
indeed often correlates to the behavior of her friends [8, 29].
The question, nevertheless, is whether the success can be
truly attributed to the ideas behind those aforementioned
techniques? We argue that, while the general idea of incorporating the item selection behavior of friends is in the right
direction, the heuristics adopted in these existing works do
not exactly capture the core factors and thus cannot be fully
accounted for the claimed success.
In this paper, we take the view of “social inﬂuence” from
friends to explain the decision making of item selection by
a user. Social inﬂuence here refers to the phenomenon that
a user adopts a suggestion from friends, which may or may
not deviate from her own preferences.1 In our daily life, besides our own preference, we usually turn to our friends for
opinions of books, movies or restaurants. Obviously, friends
play a role in our decision making of many daily activities
and events and thus impose some inﬂuence on us. Nevertheless, the inﬂuences from diﬀerent friends are not equal.
We do not take friends’ opinions/suggestions purely based
on our “trust” or “similarity” in preferences. Moreover, some
friends with diﬀerent interests and expertise may be very
inﬂuential to us, while some other friends with very similar
interests may not contribute that much in our decision making. Therefore, the notion of social inﬂuence discussed here
is fundamentally diﬀerent from the social correlation, trust
intensity, or the various measures of friend similarity based
on diﬀerent heuristics.
To systematically exploit social inﬂuences from friends for
item recommendation, we aim to quantitatively capture the
social inﬂuence to a user from each of her friends by leveraging information embedded in the user social network, user
behavior and item content. To meet our goal, we propose to
adopt the probabilistic generative model as a methodology
to model the decision making of item selection, e.g., deciding which restaurant to dine. We attribute an item selection
decision by a user probabilistically to her own preference or
the preferences of her friends (due to social inﬂuence). Assuming a set of latent topics existing in the targeted application domain2 , we propose the social influenced selection
(SIS) model, which captures (1) the distribution of social
inﬂuence from friends for each user, (2) the distribution of
personal preference over the latent topics for each user, (3)
the distribution of generated items for each topic, (4) the
distribution of generated content for each topic; and thus
enables a seamless integration of social inﬂuence, user behavior and item content for item recommendation.
Based on SIS, we aim to mine the model parameters listed
above from the social network of users and the access transactions of users on items (as well as their content) through
statistical inference based on expectation maximization (EM).
In a typical EM algorithm, the E-step is used for computing the posterior of a latent variable. The multiple layers of
variables we have in SIS bring new challenges. For example, the latent variables and other associated factors need
to be processed together in a very large joint-variable space,

• We point out the conceptual diﬀerence between the
social inﬂuence introduced in this paper and the ideas
behind other existing recommendation techniques that
incorporate social friendship. We argue for using social inﬂuence along with user preference in item recommendation and we propose a probabilistic generative
model, namely social influenced selection, that explicitly quantiﬁes and incorporates social inﬂuence from
friends to a user, along with user preference and item
content in the item selection process.
• We develop a new model parameter learning algorithm
to infer two layers of latent variables, including inﬂuential friends and latent topics, seamlessly in the learning
process. The algorithm exploits the social networks
among friends to address the scalability issue resulted
from the joint-variable space.
• We demonstrate that the social inﬂuence mined based
on SIS is valuable for supporting group recommendations, viral marketing, and various user analyses.
• We conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation
on two real datasets crawled from last.fm and whrrl.com.
Experimental results validate our ideas and show that
social inﬂuence is eﬀective for enhancing both item recommendation and group recommendation. We also
ﬁnd that users in whrrl.com is more likely to get inﬂuenced by friends than those in last.fm.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes the related work. Section 3 introduces our
SIS model which seamlessly captures social inﬂuence along
with user behavior and item content. Section 4.1 proposes
a new group recommendation method using the social inﬂuence obtained and discusses its potential application for viral
marketing. Section 5 reports the experimental results and
ﬁndings in our performance evaluation. Finally, Section 6
concludes the paper the points out the future direction.

2. RELATED WORK
In this section, we review some related works, including
recommender systems, recommendation techniques enriched
by social networks, and group recommendation.
Item recommendation is a crucial service for e-commerce
and web services (e.g. netﬂix.com and amazon.com). The
goal is to recommend a list of items that a targeted user may
be interested in. Collaborative ﬁltering and content-based
techniques are two widely adopted approaches for recommender systems [1]. Both of them discover users’ personal
interests and utilize these interests to ﬁnd relevant items.
Collaborative ﬁltering techniques [4, 9, 28] automatically
predict relevant items for a given user by referencing item
rating information from other similar users. Content-based
techniques [23] make recommendations by matching a user’s
personal interests (or proﬁle) to descriptive information of
items. Recommender systems using pure collaborative ﬁltering approaches tend to fail when little knowledge about the
user is known or when no one has similar interests with the
user. For example, if a user has little item rating/selection
history or his interests are uncommon to others, then the

many diﬀerent phenomena. For example, Herbert Kelman
identiﬁed three broad varieties of social inﬂuence including
compliance, identiﬁcation and internalization [14]. In this
paper, we consider the social inﬂuence quantitatively as the
probability that a user adopts a suggestion from friends.

evidence of inﬂuence propagation via on-line social links [12,
16], one important factor we argued for, along with user preference, is the social inﬂuence. Instead of trying to capture
exactly how social inﬂuence takes eﬀect in the decision making process3 , we assume the existence of social inﬂuence and
aim to capture quantiﬁed social inﬂuence among friends for
use in recommender systems. In the following, we ﬁrst introduce our social influenced selection (SIS) model and then
present our approach to statistically inference a number of
model parameters valuable for recommendation services and
other applications.

item rating/selection history of other users cannot help. Although content-based methods is able to cope with the issue of lacking knowledge, it fails to account for community
endorsement. For example, while a user is known to be interested in Chinese restaurants, content-based methods may
possibly recommend a bad Chinese restaurant to him without considering the tendency or consensus among those with
similar item selection behavior to the targeted user. As a result, there has been a continuing research interests and eﬀort
in combining the advantages of both collaborative ﬁltering
and content-based methods [3, 26]. Our proposal not only
is able to take into account user behavior and item content
but also incorporate the social inﬂuence from friends into
the recommendation process.
We term the techniques that exploit observations and properties of social networks for recommendation as social recommendation techniques. As reported in the literature, social friendship is shown to be beneﬁcial for recommendation
[19, 18, 17, 12, 16, 32, 31, 6]. To incorporate social friendship to the recommender system, [32] propose a collaborative recommendation framework which linearly combines
conventional user-based collaborative ﬁltering with friendbased collaborative ﬁltering (i.e., only friends are considered
during the collaborative ﬁltering approach). In addition, [12,
16] employ the random walk approach [30] to incorporate
user’s social network in item recommendation. There are
also some model-based approaches to provide recommendation by incorporating social friendship or social trust network [17, 18, 19, 6]. In [17, 18, 19], the authors propose
to use matrix factorization method to learn the user latent
vectors and item latent vectors. Accordingly, they integrate
the users’ social trust network into their models through a
linear combination [17, 18] or as a regularization term [19].
In [6], the social correlation among friends is learned with
the condition that latent user space and latent item space
are given. Notice that the social correlation aims to capture
the similarity among friends. Thus, the social correlation
among friends could reach 1 if they have identical item access patterns. In our study, we are interested in social inﬂuence. Intuitively, we believe that a user make decisions
mainly based on her own preferences, even though friends’
preferences and inﬂuence may contribute to her decisions.
In this paper, we also explore the potential use of social inﬂuence for group recommendation. Here we review
a number of group recommendation techniques. Group recommendations have been designed for various domains such
as web/news pages [25], tourism [22], music [21, 7], and TV
programs and movies [24, 33]. In summary, two main approaches have been proposed for group recommendation [13].
The ﬁrst one creates an aggregated proﬁle for a group based
on individual proﬁles of its group members and makes recommendations based on the aggregated group proﬁle [21,
33]. The second approach aggregates the recommendation
results for individual members into a single group recommendation list. In other words, recommendations (i.e., ranked
item lists) for individual members are created independently
and then aggregated into a joint group recommendation
list [2], where the aggregation functions could be based on
average or least misery strategies [20]. Diﬀerent from these
prior works, our approach exploits the preferences of group
members and their inﬂuence on each other to reach the ﬁnal
decision. Evaluation from real datasets demonstrates a signiﬁcant improvement from the our proposal of using social
inﬂuence alone over the state-of-the-art methods.

3.1 The SIS Model
In addition to personal preference of certain items and
their speciﬁc content features, we believe that social inﬂuence from friends also contribute to one’s item selection decision. For example, Alice went for a movie “Kung Fu Panda”
because she likes funny cartoon animations and Bob, a fan
of Chinese martial art stories, had recommended it to her.
In this example, we attribute the decision of watching Kung
Fu Panda over other choices to Alice’s own preference and
Bob’s (as well as other friends’) suggestions. Notice that several factors are involved here, including (i) Alice’s tastes of
movies as well as her friend’s possible preferences; (ii) Alice’s
independence in decision making; and (iii) inﬂuences from
Alice’s friends. We argue that the decision is made implicitly
in accordance with the collective preferences of Alice’s and
her friends’. Thus, the decision making is similar to drawing a preference from the above-mentioned collection based
on Alice’s independence in decision making and her friend’s
inﬂuence. Consequently, a preference common to Alice and
her friends has a higher probability to be drawn than an
uncommon preference from some friend (which may have a
lower probability but still possible, as evident by abnormal
selection behavior sometimes made by people).

Figure 1: The SIS model
In the proposed SIS model, as shown in Figure 1, we follow
the ideas of [11, 26] to represent user preferences in terms
of a number of latent topics and to correlate the items (and
their content) with users through these latent topics. Let
U = {u1 , u2 , · · · , uN } and I = {i1 , i2 , · · · , iM } be the user
set and item set, respectively. Each item i ∈ I is associated
with a set of tags/words Wi = {w1 , w2 , · · · }. A latent topic
set Z = {z1 , z2 , · · · , zK } is employed to capture the latent
user interests (i.e., preferences) and to characterize the items
and their content. The SIS model assumes that a decision
made by a user u ∈ U to select an item i ∈ I (associated
with a tag w ∈ Wi ) is attributed to a preference (i.e., one
of the latent topics z ∈ Z) due to the user’s independent
choice and the social inﬂuence from friends. For instance, in

Pr(z|f ) = PPr(z,f
r(f )
We will show how these parameters can be used to facilitate
various applications in Section 4.
In this study, we employ expected maximization (EM) to
learn those model parameters from the user-item-content
history H, i.e., u, i, w ∈ H, where u ∈ U , i ∈ I, and
w ∈ Wi (i.e., Wi denotes the tag/word set associated with
item i). Note that an item may contain multiple tags/words.
For a history record of a user u selecting an item i where
Wi = {w1 , w2 , · · · }, we have u, i, wk  ∈ H, k = 1, 2, · · · .
Note that existing expected maximization (EM) algorithms
mostly handle a single latent variable. Thus, it brings new
challenges when there are multiple variables, i.e., z and f ,
in the model and thus mandates a new and eﬃcient learning algorithm. To address this issue, we have performed a
detailed mathematical derivation to develop an new EM algorithm in order to learn the model parameters by statistical
inference. Our model parameter learning algorithm is based
on the idea of maximizing the log-likelihood of L(θ).

the example discussed earlier, Alice’s decision to see “Kung
Fu Panda” attributed to funny cartoon animation (her own
preference) or Chinese martial art (Bob’s preference), both
of which may be considered as the latent topics in our model.
Obviously, our goal (and the novelty of SIS) lies in qualitatively capturing the social inﬂuence, which along with other
model parameters of SIS such as user preference, is shown
later to be valuable for recommendations and various applications. Thus, we introduce another variable f to represent
the friends in SIS. Let F (u) ⊆ U denote the friend list of
a user u. The social inﬂuence to u from one of her friends
(f ∈ F (u)) is depicted as how likely f ’s personal preference
has contributed to the item selection decision. As discussed
earlier, the probability for a friend of u’s to aﬀect the item
selection is in proportional to the social inﬂuence of this
friend. Notice that u’s independence in decision making and
her personal preference play a similar but even more important role as the social inﬂuence and friends’ preferences. In
SIS, for simplicity, we assume u is a special friend of herself
(i.e., u ∈ F (u)). Therefore, the SIS model, as illustrated in
Figure 1, are depicted as follows. A decision of item selection made by user u is probabilistically determined based on
the preference of a friend (including herself) f ∈ F (u). If
f = u, the selection is attributed to u’s own preference; otherwise (f = u), the decision is inﬂuenced by f at this time
(i.e., the selection follows f ’s interests rather than u’s own
tastes). As shown in the ﬁgure, we deﬁne a parameter social
influence distribution Pr(f |u) as the probability for u to be
inﬂuenced by a friend f . Once f is picked based on Pr(f |u),
we randomly draw a topic z from f ’s preference based on
probability Pr(z|f ). Then, the topic z in turn generates an
item i and a tag w according to the topic’s item distribution
(Pr(i|z)) and topic’s content distribution (Pr(w|z)), respectively. Note that the selection behavior of user u on both
item i and its content w ∈ Wi is probabilistically captured
in a coherent fashion by the generative process of SIS. Thus,
SIS is able to comprehensively incorporates various information, including social inﬂuence, user behavior and item
content, in the model.

where θ denotes the model parameters, i.e., Pr(z), Pr(u|f ),
Pr(f |z), Pr(i|z), Pr(w|z), in our model.
The derived EM algorithm iterates over the following steps.In
E-step, instead of computing the expectation of the loglikelihood for individual latent variables (i.e. z and f sep” of the logarately), we propose to compute the expectation
likelihood for z, f  jointly. More speciﬁcally, we calculate
Pr(z, f |u, i, w)

f ∈F (u) Pr(z) Pr(f |z) Pr(u|f ) Pr(i|z) Pr(w|z)

Note that we only need to compute the posteriors of those
triples u, i, w ∈ H, because the expectation to be maximized only weights on the observed user-item-word triples.
While the friend space could potentially be the entire user
space, the averaged number of friends per user is limited.4
The total size of parameters Pr(z, f |u, i, w) for each record
u, i, w is estimated by |z| · |F (u)|.
In EM algorithms, the E-step is to calculate the expected
value of the log likelihood function, with respect to the conditional distribution of latent variables, under the current
estimate of the model parameters. In our algorithm, z and
f are considered jointly in E-step. This is very important
because, if we consider only a one latent variable, say z,
the M-step cannot estimate the parameter Pr(f |z), which
depends on the joint probability of z and f .
In M-step, model parameters are computed to maximize
the expected log-likelihood
found on the E-step as below.

Pr(i|z) ∝

The problem of recommending new (previously unaccessed)

for u to select an item i (i.e., Pr(i|u)). Candidate items with
the highest aforementioned probability are recommended to
u. Note that Pr(i|u) can be computed as

The key observations from this model as shown in Figure 1
are 1) u and z are independently conditioned on f , and 2)
f, w and i are independently conditioned on z. To model the
item selection probability in terms of f and z, we transform
Equation (3) into the following form:

APPLICATIONS OF SOCIAL INFLUENCE

In this section, we discuss how social inﬂuence learned
from SIS beneﬁts other applications such as group recommendation and viral marketing.

Sinfluence (G2 , i) = P r(u1 , u2 , i) + P r(u2 , u1 , i)

4.1 Group Recommendation
Given a group of people G, group recommendation aims to
identify items that are welcomed by the whole group instead
of individual group members, e.g., ﬁnd romantic restaurants
for a couple or movies for a family with kids. Although the
SIS model targets on item recommendation for an individual user, the social inﬂuence learned based on SIS is very
useful for group recommendation. In this section, we ﬁrst
brieﬂy introduce the aggregation-based group recommendation strategies and then discuss our new strategy, called social influence based group recommendation (SIG).
For group recommendation, a widely adopted approach is
to apply some aggregation strategies to obtain a “consensus”
group ranking/score for a candidate item. Two popular aggregation strategies, namely average and least misery, are
proposed in [20].Using the item access probability estimation Pr(i|u) as the score of item i to u, the average strategy
calculates the group score of an item i to a group G as

four two-member groups

The ideas described above can be generalized for groups
with more than two members by decomposing such a group
into a set of two-member groups based on the friendship of
members (see the example in Figure 2 for illustration). To
make a group recommendation, we assume the social inﬂuence only happens between friends. Intuitively, if most pairs
of friends in the group prefer a particular item, it would be
a good candidate for recommendation to the group. Let
G denote a group with arbitrary cardinality. The score
for recommending an item i to G is deﬁned as the sum
of Sinfluence (G2 , i) score over all possible friend pairs in the
group. Formally,

Sinfluence (G, i) =

(11)
The ranking of items for group recommendation is based on
the sorted group scores of items as deﬁned above. We ﬁnd
superior performance of our social-inﬂuence strategy over
the two aggregation strategies (to be shown in Section 5.6).

4.2 Viral Marketing
Recently, the phenomenon of inﬂuence propagation in social networks and its application in viral marketing have
attracted tremendous interest. The idea is that when a user
sees her social contacts performing an action such as purchasing a product, that user may decide to adopt the purchase as well [27, 15, 5, 10]. Obviously, social inﬂuence is
important for viral marketing. In this section, we demonstrate how the social inﬂuence and user preference derived
from our SIS model can be applied in the viral marketing
study. Although the user-item selection process in SIS does
not capture the causality in inﬂuence propagation, we assume that the social inﬂuence learned from our model may
approximate the probability for a user to adopt the product
given that her friend adopts the product.
Conventional research of viral marketing are mainly based
on the social inﬂuence probability from f to u, i.e., Pr(u|f ).
We argue that, in addition to social inﬂuence, the personal
preferences of users are also very important for viral marketing. Note that, as discussed earlier, a friend f showing
high social inﬂuence to a user u doesn’t necessarily implies
that f and u are highly similar in terms of their item access

f ∈(F (u)∩G)

Pr(u, f, i) =

u4

Figure 2: Decompose an arbitrary group into a set
of two-member groups.

Basically, the item least disliked by each individual member
shall has the highest group score for recommendation.
Note that Pr(i|u) can be calculated based on our generative model by incorporating user behavior (UB) and item
content (IC). These two aggregation-based group recommendation approaches capture a group consensus of item ranking
by assuming all the decisions made by users are independent
and equally important. However, in a group activity, people
interact with and inﬂuence each other. Thus, we take social
inﬂuence into account to reach a group consensus.
Intuitively, a user in a group activity selects an item due
to two possible reasons: 1) her own preference of the item,
2) inﬂuence from other group members. One direct extension of the existing aggregation-based group recommendation strategies is to is to incorporate social inﬂuence in the
calculation of probability value Pr(i|u).

On the other hand, the least misery strategy calculates the
the group score for an item i to a group G as the smallest
predicted rating for item i in the group, speciﬁcally
Smisery (G, i) = min{Pr(i|u)}

An alternative idea is that users in a group will listen to
others’ opinions, i.e., social inﬂuence (instead of personal
preferences) is given the highest priority to get a consensus
score for the group. SIS can naturally support the group
recommendation as a group selection activity, i.e., u is inﬂuenced by other group members to jointly select item i.
Consider a “two-member” group G2 = {u1 , u2 }. To select
an item for the group, user u1 may inﬂuence user u2 and
vice versa. Therefore, we deﬁne the score for recommending
an item i to the group G2 as

can be easily obtained from the model parameters of SIS.
Note that Pr(u, f, i) denotes the probability for u to select
i under inﬂuence of f . If f = u, it estimates the probability
that the user u’s own preference in this item. This newly
derived Pr(i|u) is applicable to Average (Equation (6)) and
Least Misery (Equation (7)) for group recommendation.

In our evaluation, we adopt the memory-based collaborative ﬁltering approach (denoted as CF) as a baseline and
propose to study the eﬀectiveness of various factors (i.e.,
social inﬂuence (SI), user behavior (UB) and item content
(IC)) considered in our SIS model. The diﬀerent conﬁgurations of factors included in our evaluation are: 1) user
behavior (UB) [11], which is taken as the second baseline,
2) both user behavior and social inﬂuence (UB+SI), 3) user
behavior and item content factors (UB+IC) [26], which is
the third baseline, and 4) all of the user behavior, social inﬂuence and item content factors (UB+SI+IC), i.e., our SIS
model. In this evaluation, we conduct an extensive set of
experiments for item recommendation, group recommendation, viral marketing, and various user analysis studies.

behaviors. Intuitively, whether a product will be adopted by
a user is dependent on user preference of the product itself,
even though we fully agree that social inﬂuence is important for viral marketing. In short, we argue that both user’s
preference and social inﬂuence are critical ro viral marketing. If solely based on social inﬂuence, a product marketing
plan may likely to target on a user with high social inﬂuence
and high interest in the product (even if his friends are not
interested in the product based on their own preferences).
As a result, the aforementioned conventional viral marketing
plan based purely on social inﬂuence could fail.
Here, we adopt the popular Threshold Model [15] as a case
study to demonstrate how to utilize the social inﬂuence and
user preferences obtained based on SIS for viral marketing
strategy design. Note that, in a viral marketing study, each
individual user is assumed to be either active (an adopter of
the product) or inactive. We assume a setting where each
user’s tendency to become active increases monotonically as
more of her friends become active and focus on the case
where users only switch from being inactive to being active,
instead of switching in the other direction. In the model, the
probability for a user u to an item i is denoted as PrV M (i|u),
which is calculated as follows. Let F (u) denote the friend
set of user u and F  (u) ⊂ F (u) denote the subset including
all active friends.

Here we ﬁrst discuss the datasets, i.e., last.fm and whrrl.com,
used in our experiments. Last.fm is an on-line music radio
web service and whrrl.com is a location-based social network web service. The last.fm dataset contains music access history of 3, 143 users over 23, 467 unique songs; while
whrrl.com dataset includes the check-in history of 7, 145
users to 74, 217 unique places. It is worth noting that the
whrrl.com dataset includes 17,587 group check-in records
which are very valuable for evaluating the group recommendation approaches. Additionally, both datasets have their
user social networks available. The basic statistics of these
two datasets are summarized in Table 1.

where α is a weighting factor between 0 and 1. α = 1 means

Note that the eﬀectiveness of recommendation service provisioned with sparse dataset (i.e., low-density user-item matrix) is usually not high. For example, the reported precision
in [32] is 0.05 over a preprocessed dataset with 2.72×10−4
density. Thus, in our experiments, we focus on comparing
the relative performance of algorithms instead of their absolute eﬀectiveness measures, which are expected to improve
over time as the number of social network users continues to
grow. Speciﬁcally, we use UB as the reference to compare
the relative eﬀectiveness measures, which are calculated as

Each user u has a threshold θu . Once PrV M (i|u) exceeds the threshold θu , user u will turn to active. The process of viral marketing starts with an initial set of users S.
Users in S get to know the item i by advertisement. Thus,
a seed user s ∈ S has a initial probability PrV M (i|s) =
α PrV M −self (i|s). Of course, for viral marketing, we always
want to select users interested in the items as the seed users.
The diﬀusion process unfolds deterministically in discrete
steps: in step t, all users who were active in step t − 1
remain active; and we update the value of PrV M (i|u) for
each inactive user u and activate any user u for which its
PrV M (i|u ) ≥ θu .

PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

In this section, we conduct a comprehensive performance
evaluation using two real datasets, one from last.fm and the
other from whrrl.com. We develop web crawlers to collect
theses two datasets, which include user-item accessing history, users’ friendship network and tags associated with each
item. Besides, we collect group check-in history data from
whrrl.com to validate our group recommendation approach.

5.2 Item Recommendation
Item recommendation serves as the primary test case for
our evaluation. For the various conﬁgurations degenerated
from SIS, we use log-likelihood as model converge indicators
and terminate the EM algorithms when an additional EM

Figure 6: Performance comparisons (whrrl.com)
Figure 3 and Figure 4 show the precision and recall of
top 5 item recommendations for last.fm and whrrl.com by
varying |Z|, the size of latent topics. We ﬁnd that social
inﬂuence indeed improves the recommendation performance,
for both UB+SI against UB and SIS against UB+IC. The
result shows that the best recommendation performance is
reached when the chosen topic size is around 60. Therefore,
we set the default value of the latent topic size to 60 for the
remaining experiments.
Figure 5 and Figure 6 compare the performance of various item recommendation approaches, using last.fm and
whrrl.com, respectively. Note that UB’s performance is used
as the reference and these two ﬁgures demonstrate the performance ratio against the UB. As shown, all the modelbased approaches clearly outperform the conventional memorybased collaborative ﬁltering (CF), i.e., values of CF are smaller
than 1 while all other ratio values are greater than 1. Again,
we ﬁnd that leveraging the social inﬂuence indeed improves
the performance (i.e., values of UB+SI are greater than 1
and values of SIS are greater than those of UB+IC). Most

Here, we study the latent topics learned from our SIS
model. Notice that, in SIS, a latent topic is represented by
a joint distribution of item and content. Figure 7 shows
some latent topics learned from the whrrl.com dataset. As
shown, places located in distance tend to belong to diﬀerent
latent topics (e.g., places in topic 15 and topic 49), while
categorical tags with very diﬀerent semantics also tend to
belong to diﬀerent latent topics (e.g., representative tags in
topic 39 and topic 49). Obviously, in the whrrl.com dataset,
the content and locations of places both have an important
role in determining the latent topics. We ﬁnd that several
latent topics have similar representative tags, e.g., topic 15
and topic 49, but located in distance. On the other hand,
some latent topics that are clustered at the same areas, e.g.,
topic 1 and topic 15, have quite diﬀerent tags. Moreover,
items (even with similar contents) in diﬀerent spatial clusters tend to be in diﬀerent latent topics, which conﬁrms
that the learned latent topics from our SIS model are distributions over both items (which exhibit strong locality in
whrrl.com dataset) and their content.

By comparing results between last.fm and whrrl.com datasets,
we ﬁnd that the friend inﬂuence in whrrl.com is smaller than
that in last.fm. As shown in Figure 9(a), 95% (for last.fm)
and 99% (for whrrl.com) of friend-pairs have friend inﬂuence
values less than 0.05, respectively. This is probably because
users in whrrl.com have more friends than users in last.fm
(i.e., average 9.08 friends in whrrl.com vs. 1.91 friends in
last.fm). Usually not all friends are inﬂuential and, very often, a small number of friends take the most part of social
inﬂuence. From Figure 9(b), we ﬁnd that although both
datasets suggest signiﬁcant independent selection probabilities, users in whrrl.com have smaller independent selection
probabilities than those in last.fm. As shown in Figure 9(b),
5% (for whrrl.com) and 1% (for last.fm) of users have independent selection probability smaller than 0.8, respectively.
Generally speaking, the social inﬂuence of users in location
check-in activities is more signiﬁcant than those in music
listening activities. One explanation is that location checkins are inherently social activities while music listening is
usually for self-entertainment.

user profiles. In this section, we analyze two user proﬁles
to facilitate a better understanding of user behaviors. In
Figure 10, we show the proﬁle of user 338 (consisting of
her preference of latent topics and inﬂuence from friends)
from last.fm dataset. As shown, user 338 is inﬂuenced by
user 1196 and user 668, with the inﬂuence probability values 0.005 and 0.043, respectively (other friends with lower
inﬂuences to user 338 are omitted). Also, the top 5 topics
of users’ preferences are also shown, where the probabilities
representing users’ interests in the topics are labeled in the
corresponding edges. Notice that there are 4 overlapped topics for user 1196 and user 338; while there are 3 overlapped
topics between user 668 and user 338. In terms of common
interests, user 1196 is more similar/correlated to user 338
than user 668. However, we ﬁnd that user 668 exhibits more
social inﬂuence upon user 338 than user 1196 does. Notice
that the notion of social inﬂuence in our SIS model is able
to capture the “abnormal” behavior of a user due to inﬂuence from her friends. Figure 10 conﬁrms that friends with
high correlation/similarity or share a lot common items do
not necessarily exhibit strong social inﬂuence, while friends
with less overlapped interests may still be quite inﬂuential,
as some friends may have some special knowledge useful to
others.5 . Similarly, we study the user proﬁle discovered from
whrrl.com dataset. Figure 11 shows a user proﬁle for user 8,
consisting of his top ranked topics and social inﬂuence from
two most inﬂuential friends, i.e., user 65 and user 2175. As
shown, user 65 and user 2175 have the same inﬂuence on user
8 (who is relatively weak in independent selection) although
they have diﬀerent degrees of overlapped topics with user 8.
Again, social correlation and similarity between friends do
not reﬂect the social inﬂuence between them.

In this section, we study the social inﬂuence between friends.
Instead of investigating how social inﬂuence improves the
recommendation performance, here we analyze the role of
user inﬂuence in diﬀerent application domains (i.e., music
listening vs. location check-in). We plot the distributions of
social inﬂuence probabilities, denoted as Pr(u|f ), among all
friend-pairs in Figure 9(a). Additionally, we also consider
the probability for a user u to make independent selection
(denoted as Pr(u|u)) and plot the distributions of independent selection probabilities in Figure 9(b). Intuitively, we
believe users making decisions mainly based on their own
preferences, although friends’ opinions may aﬀect the decision making to certain degree, i.e., the probability for a user
to follow an uncommon preference of his friends is relatively
small. Here, our experiments based on the dataset last.fm
and whrrl.com conﬁrm this intuition.

Figure 13: A subgraph of social network labeled
with social influence and user preference.
To validate our idea about using social inﬂuence together
with user preference for viral marketing study, we present
a case to demonstrate that our approach can identify good
targets for marketing. Here, we extract a small social graph
from the last.fm dataset as shown in Figure 13. The social inﬂuence learned from SIS are labeled as the weight of
social links in the ﬁgure. Here we select an item 2940 from
last.fm as the marketing item for our case study. We also list
each user’s preference to item 2940 on the left-lower corner
of Figure 13. In this study based on the Threshold Model,
we compare the eﬀect of viral marketing with two diﬀerent approaches: 1) a conventional method (baseline), solely
based on the social inﬂuence; and 2) our proposal, which
combines both user preference and social inﬂuence. In the
experiments, we set the threshold θu as 0.01 and the weight
between user’s preference to item 2940 and the inﬂuence
from friends as 0.5. As such, these two methods execute for
10 iterations. For each seed user s, the corresponding eﬀect
of viral marketing Vs (i.e., ﬁnal number of activated users)
are shown in Table 2, indicating our proposal is expected to
be more eﬀective than (or at least complementary to) the
baseline.

the 17, 587 group check-in records in whrrl.com in our experiment, where we consider a group check-in record (i.e.,
the ground truth) at a time and take the average of tested
records. Notice that a record indicates a group of people visiting a place. An eﬀective group recommendation algorithm
should have this place ranked high among all the places recommended. Therefore, we propose a metric called relative
ranking to evaluate the performance of the group recommendation algorithms. Suppose that a given algorithm returns a
ranked list of m items (i.e., all places in this experiment). If
the actual visited place is ranked in the l-th position of the
returned recommendation list, the relative ranking is calculated as ml . For example, if an actual visited place is ranked
10th among a total of 100 items returned by a group recommendation algorithm, the relative ranking is 10/100 = 0.1).

Figure 12: Group recommendation (whrrl.com)
Figure 12 compares the performance of SIG, Average and
Least Misery. The values in Y-axis represent the relative
rankings of actual visited places (the lower the better). The
conventional Average and Least Misery strategies are devised based on user behavior (UB) and item content (IC).
Here we also implement both algorithms using the model
parameters discovered based on our SIS model. The result
shown in Figure 12(a) indicates that SIG always outperforms the other four and reach its optimal point when the
topic size is around 60. Besides, we also observe that our
SIS model enhances the performance of both Average and
Least Misery algorithms. Recall that the SIG algorithm only
takes into account the social inﬂuence (without considering
the user preference) in making group recommendation. The
result is surprising as we may think that both preferences
and social inﬂuence of group members are important for a
group of whrrl users to decide where to go. However, this
experimental result may hint that people tend to listen to
other people’s opinions, by compromising their own preference, in group activities. Thus, social inﬂuence based group
recommendation shows the best performance.
In Figure 12(b), we ﬁnd that SIG outperforms the AverageSIS and Least Misery-SIS strategies for most group sizes (the
result for conventional implementations are not shown for
clarity of presentation). However, as the group size growing
larger, the improvement obtained from SIG decreases. This
ﬁnding implies that for smaller groups, the social inﬂuence
among group members plays a major role in item selection
for the group. However, for larger groups, the group consensus aggregated from individual preferences may dominate
the group decision, as it probably becomes too complicated
to communicate with all members when the group is large.
This ﬁnding is consistent with our experience in activity
planning, i.e., for a smaller group, one or two inﬂuencing
members may signiﬁcantly determine the activity venue. On
the other hand, for a large group, the social inﬂuence from
individuals may become diﬃcult to take eﬀect on the entire
group. As a result, the group’s common interest dominates.

Table 2: Comparison of viral marketing strategies
We also use the diﬀerent seed selection made in both methods to illustrate the importance of taking into account both
the user preference and social inﬂuence for viral marketing.
Notice that our proposal suggests to start with seed user 5
but the baseline method suggests user 4. Obviously, user
4 is chosen by the baseline because i) she has high social
inﬂuence to her neighbors, and ii) she is at the center of the
social network. Under this reasoning, user 5 or 6 are inferior to user 4 because they have lower inﬂuence, comparing
to the hub user 4. Actually, user 5 is the best choice in
our proposal because, even though user 5 may not inﬂuence
user 4 directly, user 4 can still get activated easily since she
likes the item 2940 (i.e., she has a great interest in 0.0172).
Therefore, our proposal targets on user 5.

6. CONCLUSION
In recent years, the so-called “social inﬂuence” has been
incorporated into recommender systems based on various
heuristics, e.g., assign extra similarity weight to friends in
collaborative ﬁltering. In this paper, we discuss the diﬀerences between social inﬂuence and social correlation/similarity
and argue that the phenomenon of social inﬂuence can be
captured quantitatively for use in various recommendations
and applications. We propose a probabilistic generative

679

model, called social influenced selection(SIS) model, to capture the the social inﬂuence between linked friends and user
preferences and develop an eﬃcient algorithm to discover
those valuable information from real datasets through statistical inference. A novel contribution of this work is a
coherent approach which facilitates seamless integration of
social network, user behavior and item content for recommendation. Additionally, the social inﬂuence and user preference extracted based on SIS can be used for a variety of
applications, including group recommendation, viral marketing, user analysis, and topic analysis. Moreover, through
a comprehensive set of empirical experiments using datasets
collected from last.fm and whrrl.com, a number of interesting ﬁndings are obtained, including: 1) the social inﬂuence
is beneﬁcial for recommender systems and item recommendation made based on SIS (which integrates user behavior,
social inﬂuence and item content) achieves the best performance; 2) user behavior (in form of location check-ins)
in whrrl.com shows the spatial clustering phenomenon, and
items (even with similar contents) in diﬀerent spatial clusters tend to belong in diﬀerent latent topics; 3) users making
decisions mainly based on their own preferences, although
friends’ opinions may aﬀect the decision making to certain
degree, i.e., the probability for a user to follow an uncommon
preference of his friends is relatively small; 4) friends with
high correlation/similarity or share a lot of common items do
not necessarily exhibit strong social inﬂuence, while friends
with less overlapped interests may still be quite inﬂuential;
5) in group activities, people tend to listen to other people’s opinions, by compromising their own preference; and
6) combining both user preference and social inﬂuence (our
strategy for viral marketing) is expected to be more eﬀective than (or at least complementary to) the conventional
approach solely based on social inﬂuence.
As for the future work, we would like to further extend
the SIS model to capture social inﬂuences with respect to
latent topics. In addition, we also plan to conduct ﬁeld
study to demonstrate the advantages of our proposed viral
marketing strategy. Finally, instead of relying on the learned
knowledge from SIS (which for individual item selection) to
make recommendations for a group, we plan to develop a
new generative model to capture the item selection process
for group activities.
