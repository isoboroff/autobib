ABSTRACT

REFERENCES

The term online reputation addresses trust relationships amongst
agents in dynamic open systems. These can appear as ratings,
recommendations, referrals and feedback. Several reputation
models and rating aggregation algorithms have been proposed.
However, finding a trusted entity on the web is still an issue as all
reputation systems work individually. The aim of this project is to
introduce a global reputation system for electronic product
reviews that aggregates people’s opinions from different resources
(e.g. e-commerce websites, and review) with the help federated
search techniques and generate a high quality and trusted result.
The first step is to choose a range of product review collections
from e-commerce review systems (e.g. Amazon), online review
sites (e.g. Epinions), social networks (e.g. Facebook), question
and answering sites (e.g. Yahoo! Answers), and blog (e.g. My
Nokia Blog) resources. By using a federated search approach the
query (product name) will be broadcasted to the selected
resources and the result will be a list of reputation data with
various formats including star rating, text reviews, voting, video,
and so on. The focus of this work is on review text data and star
ratings.

A number of challenges including comparison issues (e.g. scale of
star ratings: five-star vs. ten-star), hierarchical reviews (e.g.
comments about reviews), choice of resources (e.g. choosing
relevant sources deepens upon query), display issue (e.g. easy for
the user), generalization issue (e.g. apply it on other domains),
synchronization problem (e.g. generate up-to-date results), and
high quality and trusted reviews will be addressed.

A sentiment analysis approach is subsequently used to extract
high quality opinions and inform how to increase trust in the
search result. The extracted opinions will be used to generate
facets for the global reputation system.
