Matching between query and document is not limited to
search, and similar problems can be observed at online advertisement, recommendation system, and other applications,
as matching between objects from two spaces. The technologies we introduce can be generalized into more general machine learning techniques, which we call learning to match.

1. INTRODUCTION
In web search, relevance is one of the most important factors to meet users’ satisfaction, and the success of a web
search engine heavily depends on its performance on relevance. It has been observed that many hard cases in search
relevance are due to term mismatch between query and document (e.g., query ‘ny times’ does not match well with document only containing ‘new york times’), and thus it is
not exaggerated to say that dealing with mismatch between
query and document is one of the most critical research
problems in web search. Recently researchers have spent
signiﬁcant eﬀort to address the grand challenge. The major approach is to conduct more query and document understanding, and perform better matching between enriched
query and document representations. With the availability
of large amount of log data and advanced machine learning techniques, this becomes more feasible and signiﬁcant
progress has been made recently.
In this tutorial, we will give a systematic and detailed presentation on newly developed machine learning technologies
for query document matching in search. We will focus on
the fundamental problems, as well as the novel solutions for
query document matching at word form level, word sense
level, topic level, and structure level. We will talk about
novel technologies about query spelling error correction [3,
13], query rewriting [1, 4, 6, 7], query classiﬁcation [2], topic
modeling of documents [5, 9], query document matching [8,
10, 11, 12], and query document-title translation. The ideas
and solutions introduced in this tutorial may motivate industrial practitioners to turn the research fruits into product
reality. The summary of the state-of-the-art methods and
the discussions on the technical issues in this tutorial may
