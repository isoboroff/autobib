ABSTRACT

1

The design and presentation of a Search Engine Results Page (SERP)
has been subject to much research. With many contemporary
aspects of the SERP now under scrutiny, work still remains in investigating more traditional SERP components, such as the result
summary. Prior studies have examined a variety of different aspects
of result summaries, but in this paper we investigate the influence
of result summary length on search behaviour, performance and
user experience. To this end, we designed and conducted a withinsubjects experiment using the TREC AQUAINT news collection
with 53 participants. Using Kullback-Leibler distance as a measure
of information gain, we examined result summaries of different
lengths and selected four conditions where the change in information gain was the greatest: (i) title only; (ii) title plus one snippet;
(iii) title plus two snippets; and (iv) title plus four snippets. Findings
show that participants broadly preferred longer result summaries,
as they were perceived to be more informative. However, their performance in terms of correctly identifying relevant documents was
similar across all four conditions. Furthermore, while the participants felt that longer summaries were more informative, empirical
observations suggest otherwise; while participants were more likely
to click on relevant items given longer summaries, they also were
more likely to click on non-relevant items. This shows that longer is
not necessarily better, though participants perceived that to be the
case – and second, they reveal a positive relationship between the
length and informativeness of summaries and their attractiveness
(i.e. clickthrough rates). These findings show that there are tensions between perception and performance when designing result
summaries that need to be taken into account.

Interactive Information Retrieval (IIR) is a complex, non-trivial process where a searcher undertakes a variety of different actions
during a search session [16]. Core to their experience and success
is the Search Engine Results Page (SERP), with its presentation and
design over the years having been subject to much research. With
more complex components now becoming commonplace in modern day Web search engines (such as the information card [5, 36]
or social annotations [35]), much work however still remains on
examining how more traditional SERP components (such as result
summaries) are designed and presented to end users.
Result summaries have traditionally been viewed as the ‘ten
blue links’ with the corresponding URL of the associated document,
and one or more textual snippets of keywords-in-context from the
document itself, approximately 130-150 characters (or two lines)
in length [15]. Numerous researchers have explored result summaries in a variety of different ways, such as: examining their
length [11, 19, 38]; the use of thumbnails [47, 52]; their attractiveness [9, 14]; and the generation of query-biased snippets [41, 48].
The performance of users has broadly been evaluated in a limited
fashion (e.g. by examining task completion times). In this work, we
are interested in how the length and information content of result
summaries affects SERP interactions and a user’s ability to select
relevant over non-relevant items. Prior research has demonstrated
that longer result summaries tend to lower completion times for
informational tasks (where users need to find one relevant document) [11], but does this hold in other contexts, specifically for
ad-hoc retrieval, where users need to find several relevant items?
Furthermore, how does the length and information associated with
longer result summaries affect the user’s ability to discern the relevant from the non-relevant?
This work therefore serves as an investigation into the effects
of search behaviour and search performance when we vary (i) result summary snippet lengths, and by doing so (ii) the information
content within the summaries. To this end, a within-subjects crowdsourced experiment (n = 53) was designed and conducted. Under
ad-hoc topic retrieval, participants used four different search interfaces, each with a different size of result summary. Findings allow
us to address the two main research questions of this study. RQ1
How does the value of information gain represented as snippet
length affect behaviour, performance and user experience? RQ2
Does information gain – again represented as snippet length – affect the decision making ability and accuracy (identifying relevant
documents) of users? We hypothesise that longer and more informative snippets will enable users to make better quality decisions
(i.e. higher degrees of accurately identifying relevant content).

upon how these summaries should be generated [30, 31, 39, 48, 51].
These early works proposed the idea of summarising documents
with respect to the query (query-biased summaries) or keywords-incontext – as opposed to simply extracting the representative or lead
sentences from the document [29]. Tombros and Sanderson [48]
showed that subjects of their study were likely to identify relevant
documents more accurately when using query-biased summaries,
compared to summaries simply generated from the first few sentences of a given document. Query-biased summaries have also
been recently shown to be preferred on mobile devices [45].
When constructing snippets using query-biased summaries, Rose
et al. [41] found that a user’s perceptions of the result’s quality
were influenced by the snippets. If snippets contained truncated
sentences or many fragmented sentences (text choppiness), users
perceived the quality of the results more negatively, regardless of
length. Kanungo and Orr [21] found that poor readability also impacts upon how the resultant snippets are perceived. They maintain
that readability is a crucial presentation attribute that needs to be
considered when generating a query-biased summary. Clarke et
al. [9] analysed thousands of pairs of snippets where result A appeared before result B, but result B received more clicks than result
A. As an example, they found results with snippets which were
very short (or missing entirely) had fewer query terms, were not as
readable, and attracted fewer clicks. This led to the formulation of
several heuristics relating to document surrogate features, designed
to emphasise the relationship between the associated page and
generated snippet. Heuristics included: (i) ensuring that all query
terms in the generated snippet (where possible); (ii) withholding
the repeating of query terms in the snippet if they were present in
the page’s title; and (iii) displaying (shortened) readable URLs.
Recent work has examined the generation of snippets from more
complex angles – from manipulating underlying indexes [4, 49] to
language modelling [14, 32], as well as using user search data to
improve the generation process [1, 42]. Previous generation approaches also may not consider what parts of a document searchers
actually find useful. Ageev et al. [1] incorporated into a new model
post-click searcher behaviour data, such as mouse cursor movements and scrolling over documents, producing behaviour-biased
snippets. Results showed a marked improvement over a strong
text-based snippet generation baseline. Temporal aspects have also
been considered – Svore et al. [46] conducted a user study, showing
that users preferred snippet text with trending content in snippets
when searching for trending queries, but not so for general queries.

RELATED WORK

As previously mentioned, the design and presentation of SERPs
has been examined in depth. Researchers have examined various
aspects of SERPs, and how the designs of such aspects influence
the behaviour of users. Here, we provide a summary of the various
aspects that have been investigated. Specifically, we focus upon: the
layout of SERPs; the size of SERPs; how snippet text is generated;
and how much text should be presented within each result summary
– the latter being the main focus of this work.

2.1

SERP Layouts and Presentation

Early works regarding the presentation of result summaries [6, 12]
examined approaches to automatically categorise result summaries
for users, similar to the categorisation approach employed by early
search engines. Chen and Dumais [6] developed an experimental
system that automatically categorised result summaries on-the-fly
as they were generated. For a query, associated categories were
then listed as verticals, with associated document titles provided
underneath each category header. Traditional result summaries
were then made available when hovering over a document title.
Subjects of a user study found the interface easier to use than the
traditional ‘ten blue links’ approach - they were 50% faster at finding
information displayed in categories. This work was then extended
by Dumais et al. [12], where they explored the use of hover text
to present additional details about search results based upon user
interaction. Searching was found to be slower with hover text,
perhaps due to the fact that explicit decisions about when to seek
additional information (or not to) were required.
Alternatives to the traditional, linear list of result summaries
have also been trialled (like grid-based layouts [8, 20, 40]). For
example, Krammerer and Beinhaur [20] examined differences in
user behaviour when interacting with a standard list interface, compared against a tabular interface (title, snippet and URL stacked
horizontally in three columns for each result), and a grid-based
layout (result summaries placed in three columns). Users of the
grid layout spent more time examining result summaries. The approach demonstrated promise in overcoming issues such as position
bias [10], as observed by Joachims et al. [17].
Marcos et al. [34] performed an eye-tracking user study examining the effect of user behaviour while interacting with SERPs –
and whether the richness of result summaries provided on a SERP
(i.e. result summaries enriched with metadata from corresponding
pages) impacted upon the user’s search experience. Enriched summaries were found to help capture a user’s attention. Including both
textual and visual representations of a document when presenting
results could have a positive effect on relevance assessment and
query reformulation [18]. Enriched summaries were also examined
by Ali et al. [2] in the context of navigational tasks. Striking a
good balance between textual and visual cues were shown to better
support user tasks, and search completion time.

2.3

Results per Page

Today, a multitude of devices are capable of accessing the World
Wide Web (WWW) – along with a multitude of different screen
resolutions and aspect ratios. The question of how many result
summaries should be displayed per page – or results per page (RPP)
– therefore becomes hugely important, yet increasingly difficult to
answer. Examining behavioural effects on mobile devices when interacting with SERPs has attracted much research as of late (e.g. [24–
26]), and with each device capable of displaying a different number
of results above-the-fold, recent research has shown that the RPP
value can influence the behaviour of searchers [17, 25]. Understanding this behaviour can help guide and inform those charged with
designing contemporary user interfaces.

Generating Snippet Text

Users can be provided with an insight by result summaries as to
whether a document is likely to be relevant or not [14]. Consequently, research has gone into examining different kinds of snippets, and how long a snippet should be. Work initially focused

136

Session 2A: Search Interaction 1

a smaller screen. Kim et al. [27] found that subjects using longer
snippets on mobile devices exhibited longer search times and similar
search accuracy under informational tasks1 . Longer reading times
and frequent scrolling/swiping (with more viewport movements)
were exhibited. Longer snippets did not therefore appear to be very
useful on a small screen – an instant or dynamic snippet approach
(as per Paek et al. [38]) may be useful for mobile search, too.
The presentation of result summaries has a strong effect on the
ability of a user to judge relevancy [14]. Relevant documents may
be overlooked due to uninformative summaries – but conversely,
non-relevant documents may be examined due to a misleading summary. However, longer summaries also increase the examination
cost, so there is likely a trade-off between informativeness/accuracy
and length/cost. The current, widely accepted standard for result
summaries are two query-based snippets/lines [15]. This work
examines whether increasing and decreasing the length (and consequently the informativeness) of result summary snippets affects
user accuracy and costs of relevance decisions in the context of
ad-hoc topic search, where multiple relevant documents are sought.

In a Google industry report, Linden [33] however stated that
users desired more than 10RPP, despite the fact that increasing the
RPP yielded a 20% drop in traffic; it was hypothesised that this was
due to the extra time required to dispatch the longer SERPs. This
drop however be attributed to other reasons. Oulasvirta et al. [37]
discusses the paradox of choice [43] in the context of search, where
more options (results) – particularly if highly relevant – will lead
to poorer choice and degrade user satisfaction. In terms of user
satisfaction, modern search engines can therefore be a victim of
their own success, presenting users with choice overload. Oulasvirta
et al. [37] found that presenting users with a six-item search result
list was associated with higher degrees of satisfaction, confidence
with choices and perceived carefulness than an a list of 24 items.
Kelly and Azzopardi [22] broadly agreed with the findings by
Oulasvirta et al. [37]. Here, the authors conducted a betweensubjects study with three conditions, where subjects were assigned
to one of three interfaces - the baseline interface, showing 10RPP
(the ‘ten blue links’), and two interfaces displaying 3RPP and 6RPP
respectively. Their findings showed that individuals using the
3RPP and 6RPP interfaces spent significantly longer examining
top-ranking results and were more likely to click on higher ranked
documents than those on the 10RPP interface. Findings also suggested that subjects using the interfaces showing fewer RPP found
it comparatively easier to find relevant content than those using
the 10RPP interface. However, no significant difference was found
between the number of relevant items found across the interfaces.
Currently, 10RPP is still considered the de-facto standard [15].

EXPERIMENTAL METHOD

To address our two key research questions outlined in Section 1,
we conducted a within-subjects experiment. This allowed us to
explore the influence of snippet length and snippet informativeness
on search behaviours, performance and user experience. Subjects
used four different search interfaces, each of which varied the way
in which result summaries were presented to them.
To decide the length and informativeness of the result summaries, we performed a preliminary analysis to determine the average length (in words) and informativeness (as calculated by the
Kullback-Leibler distance [28] to measure information gain, or relative entropy) of result summaries with the title and varying numbers
of snippet fragments (0–10). The closer the entropy value is to zero,
the more information gained. Figure 1 plots the number of words,
the information gain, and the information gain per word2 . It is
clear from the plot that a higher level of information gain was
present in longer snippets. However, as the length increases with
each additional snippet fragment added, the informativeness per
word decreased. Consequently, for this study, we selected the four
different interface conditions in the region where informativeness
had the highest change, i.e. from zero to four. The conditions we
selected for the study were therefore:
T0 where only the title for each result summary were presented;
T1 where for each result summary, a title and one query-biased
snippet fragment were presented;
T2 where a title and two query-biased snippet fragments were
presented; and
T4 where a title and four query-biased snippet fragments were
presented,
where our independent variable is snippet informativeness, controlled by the length. Figure 2 provides an example of the different

Snippet Lengths: Longer or Shorter?

Snippet lengths have been examined in a variety of ways. A user
study by Paek et al. [38] compared a user’s preference and usability
against three different interfaces for displaying result summaries.
With question answering tasks, the interfaces: displayed a normal
SERP (i.e. a two line snippet for each summary, with a clickable
link); an instant interface, where an expanded snippet was displayed
upon clicking it; and a dynamic interface, where hovering the cursor
would trigger the expanded snippet. The instant view was shown
to allow users to complete the given tasks in less time than the
normal baseline, with half of participants preferring this approach.
Seminal work by Cutrell and Guan [11] explored the effect of
different snippet lengths (short: 1 line, medium: 2-3 lines; and long:
6-7 lines). They found that longer snippets significantly improved
performance for informational tasks (e.g. ‘Find the address for
Newark Airport.’). Users performed better for informational
queries as snippet length increased. This work was followed up by
Kaisser et al. [19]. They conducted two experiments that estimated
the preferred snippet length according to answer type (e.g. finding
a person, time, or place), and comparing the results of the preferred
snippet lengths to users’ preferences to see if this could be predicted.
The preferred snippet length was shown to depend upon the type
of answer expected, with greater user satisfaction shown for the
snippet length predicted by their technique.
More contemporary work has begun to examine what snippet
sizes are appropriate for mobile devices. Given smaller screen
sizes, this is important – snippet text considered acceptable on a
computer screen may involve considerable scrolling/swiping on

tasks considered by Kim et al. [27] were similar to those defined by Cutrell and
Guan [11], where a single relevant document was sought.
2 To obtain these values, we submitted over 300 queries from a previous study (refer
to Azzopardi et al. [3]) conducted on similar topics and on the same collection to the
search system that we used.

details our methodology for this experiment, including a discussion
of: the corpus, topics and system used (Subsection 3.1); how we
generated snippets (Subsection 3.2); the behaviours we logged (Subsection 3.3); how we obtained the opinions of subjects regarding
their experience (Subsection 3.4); and further details on our study,
including measures taken for quality control (Subsection 3.5).

within those sentences with a window of 40 characters from either
side of the term. Figure 2 provides a complete, rendered example
of the result summaries generated by each of the four interfaces.
Each result summary contains a document title, a newswire source
(acting as a replacement for a document URL), and, if required, one
or more textual snippets.

3.3

Behaviours Logged

In order for us to address our research questions, our experimental
system was required to log a variety of behavioural attributes for
each subject as they performed the variety of actions that take place
during a search session. Search behaviours were operationalised
over three types of measures: (i) interaction, (ii) performance, and
(iii) the time spent undertaking various search activities. All behavioural data was extracted from the log data produced by our
system, and from the TREC 2005 Robust Track QRELs [50]. All data
was recorded with the interface and topic combination used by the
subject at the given time.

Snippet Generation

Interaction measures included the number of queries issued, the
number of documents viewed, the number of SERPs viewed, and
the greatest depths in the SERPs to which subjects clicked on – and
hovered over – result summaries.

For interfaces T2 and T4, each result summary presented to the subjects required one or more textual snippets from the corresponding
document. These snippet fragments were query-biased [48], and
were generated by scoring sentences according to BM25 and selecting fragments from those sentences. Fragments were then extracted

For this experiment, we used the TREC AQUAINT test collection.
Using a traditional test collection provided us with the ability to
easily evaluate the performance of subjects. The collection contains
over one million newspaper articles from the period 1996-2000.
Articles were gathered from three newswires: the Associated Press
(AP); the New York Times (NYT); and Xinhua.
We then selected a total of five topics from the TREC 2005 Robust Track, as detailed by Voorhees [50]. The topics selected were:
№ 341 (Airport Security); № 347 (Wildlife Extinction); № 367 (Piracy);
№ 408 (Tropical Storms); and № 435 (Curbing Population Growth).
We selected topic № 367 as a practice topic so that subjects could
familiarise themselves with the system. These topics were chosen
based upon evidence from a previous user study with a similar setup,
where it was shown that the topics were of similar difficulty [23].
For each subject, the remaining four topics were assigned to an
interface (one of T0, T1, T2 or T4) using a Latin-square rotation.
To ground the search tasks, subjects of the experiment were instructed to imagine that they were newspaper reporters, and were
required to gather documents to write stories about the provided
topics. Subjects were told to find as many relevant documents
as they could during the allotted time, which was 10 minutes per
topic – hereafter referred to as a search session. With the traditional components of a SERP, such as the query box and result
summaries present (refer to Figure 3), subjects were instructed
to mark documents they considered relevant by clicking on the
‘Mark as Relevant’ button within the document view – accessed
by clicking on a result summary he or she thought was relevant.
Coupled with a two minute period to familiarise themselves with
the system (using topic № 367), subjects spent approximately 4550 minutes undertaking the complete experiment when pre- and
post-task surveys were accounted for.
For the underlying search engine, we used the Whoosh Information Retrieval (IR) toolkit 3 . We used BM25 as the retrieval algorithm
(b = 0.75), but with an implicit ANDing of query terms to restrict
the set of retrieved documents to only those that contained all the
query terms provided. This was chosen as most search systems
implicitly AND terms together.

Pre-task surveys consisted of five questions, each of which was
on a seven-point Likert scale (7 – strongly agree to 1 – strongly
disagree). Subjects were sought for their opinions on their: (i) prior
knowledge of the topic; (ii) the relevancy of the topic to their lives;
(iii) their desire to learn about the topic; (iv) whether they had
searched on this topic before; and (v) the perceived difficulty to
search for information on the topic.
The same Likert scale was used for post-task surveys, where subjects were asked to judge the following statements: (clarity) – the
result summaries were clear and concise; (confidence) – the result
summaries increased my confidence in my decisions; (informativeness) – the result summaries were informative; (relevance) –
the results summaries help me judge the relevance of the document;
(readable) – the result summaries were readable; and (size) – the
result summaries were an appropriate size and length.
At the end of the experiment, subjects completed an exit survey.
From five questions, they were asked to pick which of the four
interfaces was the closest fit to their experience. We sought opinions on what interface: (most informative) – yielded the most
informative result summaries; (least helpful) – provided the most
unhelpful summaries; (easiest) – provided the easiest to understand summaries; (least useful) – provided the least useful result
summaries; and (most preferred) – the subject’s preferred choice
for the tasks that they undertook.

measurements for the performance of the subject’s issued queries
for a range of rankings.
Time-Based measures included the time spent issuing queries,
examining SERPs – as well as examining result summaries4 – and
the time spent examining documents. All of these times added
together yielded the total search session time, which elapsed once
10 minutes had been reached.
From this raw data, we could then produce summaries of a search
session, producing summarising measures such as the number of
documents examined by searchers per query that they issued. We
could also calculate from the log data probabilities of interaction,
including a given subject’s probability of clicking a result summary link, given that it was TREC relevant (P (C |R)) or TREC nonrelevant (P (C |N )) – or the probability of marking a document that
was clicked, given it was either TREC relevant (P (M |R)) or TREC
non-relevant (P (M |N )). Actions such as hover depth over result
summaries were inferred from the movement of the mouse cursor,
which in prior studies has been shown to correlate strongly with
the user’s gaze on the screen [7, 44].

Crowdsourced Subjects & Quality Control

As highlighted by Zuccon et al. [54], crowdsourcing provides an
alternative means for capturing user interactions and search behaviours from traditional lab-based user studies. Greater volumes
of data can be obtained from more heterogeneous workers at a
lower cost – all within a shorter timeframe. Of course, pitfalls of a
crowdsourced approach include the possibility of workers completing tasks as efficiently as possible, or submitting their tasks without
performing the requested operations [13]. Despite these issues, it
has been shown that there is little difference in the quality between
crowdsourced and lab-based studies [54]. Nevertheless, quality
control is a major component of a well-executed crowdsourced
experiment [5]. Here, we detail our subjects and precautions taken.

Capturing User Experiences

To capture user experiences, we asked subjects to complete both
pre- and post-task surveys for each of the four interface conditions.
4 Result

summary times were approximated by dividing the total recorded SERP time
by the number of snippets hovered over with the mouse cursor. We believe this is a
reasonable assumption to make – the timings of hover events proved to be unreliable
due to occasional network latency issues beyond our control.

Table 1: Characters, words and Information Gain (IG) across
each of the four interface conditions. An ANOVA test reveals significant differences, with follow-up tests (refer to
Section 4) showing that each condition is significantly different to others. There are clearly diminishing returns in
information gain as snippet length increases. An IG value
closer to zero denotes a higher level of IG. In the table, IG/W.
denotes IG per word.

The study was run over the Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk)
platform. Workers from the platform performed a single Human
Intelligence Task (HIT), which corresponded to the entire experiment.
Due to the expected length of completion for the study (45-50
minutes), subjects who completed the study in full were reimbursed
for their time with US$9; a typically larger sum (and HIT duration)
than most crowdsourced experiments. A total of 60 subjects took
part in the experiment, which was run between July and August,
2016. However, seven subjects were omitted due to quality control
constraints (see below). In all, of the 53 subjects who satisfied the
expected conditions of the experiment, 28 were male, with 25 female.
The average age of our subjects was 33.8 years (min = 22; max = 48;
stdev = 7.0), with 19 of the subjects possessing a bachelor’s degree
or higher, and all expressing a high degree of search literacy, with
all subjects stating that they conducted at least five searches for
information online per week. With 53 subjects, each searching over
four topics, this meant a total of 212 search sessions were logged.
We examined extra precautionary measures to ensure the integrity of the log data that was recorded. Precautions were taken
from several angles. First, workers were only permitted to begin the
experiment on the MTurk platform that: (i) were from the United
States, and were native English speakers; (ii) had a HIT acceptance
rate of at least 95%; and (iii) had at least 1000 HITs approved. Requiring (ii) and (iii) reduced the likelihood of recruiting individuals
who would not complete the study in a satisfactory manner. Recruits were forewarned about the length of the HIT, which was
considerably longer than other crowdsourced experiments.
We also ensured that the computer the subject was attempting the experiment on had a sufficiently large screen resolution
(1024x768 or greater) so as to display all of the experimental interface on screen. With the experiment being conducted in a Web
browser popup window of a fixed size, we wanted to ensure that
all subjects would be able to see the same number of results on a
SERP within the popup window’s viewport. As the experiment was
conducted via a Web browser, we wanted to ensure that only the
controls provided by the experimental apparatus were used, meaning that the popup window had all other browser controls disabled
to the best of our ability (i.e. history navigation, etc.). The experimental system was tested on several major Web browsers, across
different operating systems. This gave us confidence that a similar
experience would be had across different system configurations.
We also implemented a series of log post-processing scripts after
completion of the study to further identify and capture individuals
who did not perform the tasks as instructed. It was from here that
we identified the seven subjects that did not complete the search
tasks in a satisfactory way – spending less than three of the ten
minutes searching. These subjects were excluded from the study,
reducing the number of subjects reported from 60 to 53. Finally,
results are reported based upon the first 360 seconds as some of the
remaining subjects didn’t fully use all 600 seconds.

be noted that the error bars as shown in the plots for Figures 4 and 5
refer to the standard error.
To check whether the interfaces were different with respect
to snippet length and information gain, we performed an analysis of the observed result summaries. Table 1 summarises the
number of words and characters that result summaries contained
on average. As expected, the table shows an increasing trend in
words and characters as snippet lengths increase. Information
gain for each snippet was then calculated using the KullbackLeibler distance [28] to measure information gain (e.g. relative
entropy). Statistical testing showed that the differences between
snippet length (F (3, 208) = 1.2x105 , p < 0.001) and information
gain (F (3, 208 = 2.6x105 , p < 0.001)) were significant. Follow up
tests revealed that this was the case over all four interfaces, indicating that our conditions were different on these dimensions. These
findings provide some justification for our choices for the number
of snippet fragments present for each interface – a diminishing
increase in information gain after four snippets suggested that there
wouldn’t be much point generating anything longer.

any of these measures. The number of queries issued follows a
slight downward trend as the length of result summaries increases
(3.72 ± 0.34 for T0 to 3.28 ± 0.31 for T4), as too does the number
of SERPs examined, and the number of documents examined per
query. The depth to which subjects went to per query however
follows a downward trend – as the length of snippets increases,
subjects were likely to go to shallower depths when examining
result summaries (24.47 ± 2.96 for T0 to 19.4 ± 2.04 for T4).
Interaction probabilities all showed an increasing trend as snippet length increased over the four interfaces, as shown in Table 4.
Although no significant differences were observed over the four
interfaces and the different probabilities examined, trends across all
probabilities show an increase as the snippet length increases. An
increase of both the probability of clicking result summaries on the
SERP (P (C)) and marking the associated documents (P (M )) as relevant were observed. When these probabilities are examined in more
detail by separating the result summaries clicked and documents
marked by their TREC relevancy (through use of TREC QRELs), we
see increasing trends for clicking and marking – both for TREC relevant (P (C |R) and P (M |R) for clicking and marking, respectively)
and TREC non-relevant documents (P (C |N ) and P (M |N )). This interesting finding shows that an increase in snippet length does not
necessarily improve the accuracy of subjects – simply the likelihood
that they would consider documents as relevant.

over the four interfaces for each of the performance measures examined. The performance of queries issued by subjects was very
similar across all four conditions (P@10 ≈ 0.25), along with the
number of documents identified by subjects as relevant (6.49 ± 0.58
for T2 to 7.6 ± 0.79 for T4), and the count of documents marked
that were actually TREC relevant (2.28 ± 0.25 for T1 to 2.66 ± 0.32
for T4). We also examined the number of documents marked that
were not assessed (unjudged) by the TREC assessors, in case one
interface surfaced more novel documents. On average, subjects
marked two such documents, but again there was no significant
differences between interfaces.
Time-Based Measures. Table 3 reports a series of selected interaction times over each of the four evaluated interfaces. We include:
the mean total query time per subject, per interface; the mean
time per query; the mean time spent examining documents per
query; and the mean time spent examining result summaries per
query. No significant differences were found between the mean
total query time, the time per query and the time per document.
However, a significant difference did exist for the time spent per
result summary. A clear upward trend in the time spent examining
snippets can be seen in Figure 4 as result summaries progressively
got longer, from 1.63 ± 0.13 for T0 to 2.6 ± 0.27 for T4, which was
significantly different (F (3, 208) = 3.6, p = 0.014). A follow-up
Bonferroni test showed that the significant difference existed between T0 and T4. This suggests that as result summary length
increases, the amount of time spent examining result summaries
also increases (an intuitive result). This also complies with trends
observed regarding examination depths. When the length of result summaries increased, subjects were likely to examine result
summaries to shallower depths.

Performance. Table 2 also reports a series of performance measures over the four conditions, averaged over the four topics examined. We report the mean performance of the queries issued with
P@10, the number of documents marked relevant, and the number
of documents marked relevant that were TREC relevant. Like the interaction measures above, no significant differences were observed

showed that the significant difference existed only between T0
and the remaining three interfaces, T1, T2 and T4. A series of
discernible trends can be observed throughout the responses, with
subjects regarding longer snippets as more concise, and a higher
degree of clarity (4.16±0.27 for T0 to 5.4±0.2 for T4). This perceived
clarity also made subjects feel more confident that the longer result
summaries helped them make better decisions as to whether they
were relevant to the given topic – interaction results presented
above however differ from this, where the overall probability of
marking documents increased, regardless of the document/topic
TREC relevancy judgement. Other notable trends observed from the
results included an increase in how informative subjects perceived
the result summaries to be – again, with longer summaries proving
more informative. Subjects also reported a general increase in
satisfaction of the length of the presented result summaries/snippets
– although, as mentioned, no significant difference existed between
the three interfaces that generated snippets (T1, T2 and T4).

System Evaluations. Upon completion of the study, subjects completed the exit survey as detailed in Section 3.4. Responses from
the subjects are presented in Table 6. From the results, subjects
found result summaries of longer lengths (i.e. those generated by
interfaces T2 and T4) to be the most informative, and those generated by T0 – without snippets – to be the least helpful and useful.
The longer result summaries were also consistently favoured by
subjects, who preferred them over the result summaries generated
by interfaces T0 and T1. Subjects also found the result summaries
of longer length easier to use to satisfy the given information need.
From the results, it is therefore clear that a majority of subjects preferred longer result summaries to be presented on SERPs,
generated by interfaces T2 and T4. Figure 5 provides summary
plots, showing general trends across the four interfaces, examining
observed interactions and reported experiences.

DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK

In this paper, we investigated the influence of result summary
length on search behaviour and performance. Using the KullbackLeibler distance [28] as a measure of information gain, we examined
result summaries of different lengths, selected a series of snippet
lengths where there was a significant difference in information
gain between them, which yielded the configurations for our four
experimental conditions, T0, T1, T2 and T4. We conducted a crowdsourced user study comprising of 53 subjects, each of whom undertook four search tasks, using each of the four interfaces.
Our work was focused around addressing our two research questions, which explored RQ1 how the value of information gain
(represented by snippet length) affected search behaviour and user
experience; and RQ2 whether information gain affected the decision making ability and accuracy of users. Addressing RQ1 first in
terms of search behaviour, there was little difference – but we did
observe the following trends: as summary length increases, participants: issued fewer queries; examined fewer pages; but clicked
more documents, i.e. they spent more of their time assessing documents at higher ranks. Second, our results show that in terms

Figure 5: Plots, showing a variety of measures and survey results from subjects across the four interfaces examined. From left
to right: actions associated with the subjects’ search behaviours and performance; probabilities of interaction; and post-task
survey responses, using a seven-point Likert scale (7 - strongly agree to 1 - strongly disagree).
of experience, subjects broadly preferred longer summaries. The
participants felt that longer summaries were more clear, informative, readable – and interestingly – gave them more confidence in
their relevance decisions. With respect to RQ2, we again observed
little difference in subjects’ decision making abilities and accuracy
between the four interfaces. While subjects perceived longer snippets to help them infer relevance more accurately, our empirical
evidence shows otherwise. In fact, it would appear that longer
result summaries were more attractive, increasing the information
scent of the SERP [53]. This may account for the increase in clicks
on the early results, without the benefits, however: accuracy of our
subjects did not improve with longer snippets; nor did they find
more relevant documents. Increased confidence in the result summaries (from T0 → T4) may have led to a more relaxed approach at
marking content as relevant – as can be seen by increasing click and
mark probabilities for both relevant and non-relevant content. It is
also possible that the paradox of choice [37] could play a role in shaping a user’s preferences. For example, in the condition with longer
result summaries (T4), users viewed fewer results/choices than on
other conditions. This may have contributed to their feelings of
greater satisfaction and increased confidence in their decisions.

These novel findings provide new insights into how users interact with result summaries in terms of their experiences and search
behaviours. Previous work had only focused upon task completion
times and accuracy of the first result while not considering their
experiences (e.g. [11, 19]). Furthermore, these past works were performed in the context of Web search where the goal was to find one
document. However, we acknowledge that our work also has limitations. Here, we examined out research questions – with respect
to topic search within a news collection – to explore how behaviour
and performance changes when searching for multiple relevant
documents. It would be interesting to examine this in other search
contexts, such as product search, for example. News article titles
also can be crafted differently from documents in other domains.
Summaries in this domain may perhaps be more important than
in other domains, and so the effects and influences are likely to be
larger. Furthermore, we only considered how behaviours changed
on the desktop, rather than on other devices where users are more
likely to be sensitive to such changes (e.g. [25, 27]). For example,
during casual leisure search, multiple relevant documents on tablet
devices are often found, and so it would be interesting to perform a
follow up study in this area.

To conclude, our findings show that longer result summaries,
while containing a greater amount of information content, are not
necessarily better in terms of decision making – although subjects
perceived this to be the case. We also show a positive relationship
between the length and informativeness of result summaries and
their attractiveness (clickthrough rates). These results show that the
experience and perceptions of users – and the actual performance
of those users – is different, and when designing interfaces, this
needs be taken into account.
