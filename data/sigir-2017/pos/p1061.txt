of sentences and (2) to measure the order quality, i.e. determining
how well a given list of sentences is ordered. In this paper, we focus
on the latter task. In order to measure the quality of SO, if a gold
standard is available, then correlation between the ground truth SO
and the system order (e.g. Kendall or Spearman rank correlation
coefficients) can be used [19]. The requirement of a gold standard
containing the correct SO limits the usage of such methods. Indeed,
gold standard is often not available or not obvious to build manually.
In contrast, in this paper we propose a self-sufficient metric for text
coherence assessment that does not require additional data. We
evaluate the quality of the metric using the framework proposed in
[12]. To evaluate the text coherence, we use a linguistic approach
based on the topic-comment structure of the text and inter-sentence
similarity.
A clause-level topic is the phrase in a clause that the rest of the
clause is understood to be about, and the comment is what is being
said about the topic.
According to [24], the topic does not provide new information
but connects the sentence to the context. Thus, the topic and the
comment are opposed in terms of the given/new information. The
contraposition of the given/new information is called information
structure or topic-comment structure. Going back to Example
1.1, the Nibelung and the ring in question from the first sentence
are expected to be already known by the reader, i.e. they represent
topics. However, only the next sentence provides the necessary
information. In contrast, in Example 1.2 the first mention of the
ring and the Nibelung was given at the end of the first sentence (The
Ring of the Nibelung) and then is detailed in the second sentence.
In the first sentence, Wagner’s opera title Der Ring des Nibelungen
incarnates the topic and is most literally rendered in English as The
Ring of the Nibelung corresponds to the comment. In the second
sentence, The Nibelung and the ring in question refers to topic, while
the comment parts are presented by is the dwarf Alberich and is
the one he fashions from the Rhine Gold.
Although, in literature topic-comment structure has been exploited for document re-ranking [13], classification [5], and text
summarization [11], to our knowledge, it has never been applied
for SO. The contribution of this paper is a completely automatic
approach for SO evaluation based on topic-comment structure of a
text that requires only shallow parsing and has linear complexity.
Our metric considers the pairwise term similarities of the topics
and the comments of the adjacent sentences in a text since word
repetition is one of the formal signs of text coherence [1].

ABSTRACT
Sentence ordering (SO) is a key component of verbal ability. It is also
crucial for automatic text generation. While numerous researchers
developed various methods to automatically evaluate the informativeness of the produced contents, the evaluation of readability is
usually performed manually. In contrast to that, we present a selfsufficient metric for SO assessment based on text topic-comment
structure. We show that this metric has high accuracy.

INTRODUCTION

Sentence order (SO) has a strong influence on text perception and
understanding [1]. Let consider the following example:
Example 1.1. The Nibelung is the dwarf Alberich, and the ring
in question is the one he fashions from the Rhine Gold. Wagner’s
opera title Der Ring des Nibelungen is most literally rendered in
English as The Ring of the Nibelung.
The text is hardly comprehensible. When we are reading the
Nibelung or the ring in question, we are asking ourselves what’s
it all about? which Nibelung? what question? even if in the next
sentence it becomes clearer. Let us now reverse the two sentences:
Example 1.2. Wagner’s opera title Der Ring des Nibelungen is
most literally rendered in English as The Ring of the Nibelung. The
Nibelung is the dwarf Alberich, and the ring in question is the one
he fashions from the Rhine Gold.
Now, it is clear that the Nibelung and the ring in question explain the opera title The Ring of the Nibelung. These examples
illustrate that appropriate SO is crucial for readability. Automatic
text generation, particularly multi-document extractive summarization, systems also face SO problem [3, 4]. We distinguish two
tasks related to SO: (1) to produce the best order for a given set

automatically. Several parsers have been developed to extract text
structure such as HILDA [17] that implements topic changes or
SPADE [28] which extracts rhetorical relations and has been used
in [22] for example to re-rank documents. These parsers are based
on deep analysis of linguistic features and are hardly usable when
large volumes of texts are involved. Moreover, they view the topiccomment relation as a remark on the statement while we consider
a topic as the phrase that the rest of the clause is understood to be
about as in [13].
The information structure is opposed to formal structure of a
clause with grammatical elements as constituents. In contrast to a
grammatical subject that is a merely grammatical category, a topic
refers to the information or pragmatic structure of a clause and how
it is related to other clauses. However, in a simple English clause, a
topic usually coincides with a subject. One of the exceptions are
expletives (e.g. it is raining) that have only a comment part [15].
Since the unmarked word order in English is Subject - Verb - Object
(SVO), we can assume that a topic is usually placed before a verb.
As in [13], we also assume that if a subordinate clause provides
details on an object, it is rather related to a comment part. Thus,
in our method we split a sentence into two parts by a personal
verb (not infinitive nor participle) where the first part is considered
to be a topic while the rest is viewed as a comment. As opposed
to other methods from the literature, this method requires only
part-of-speech tagging and its computational complexity is linear
over the number of words as well as the number of sentences in a
text.
The key idea of our method is that in a coherent text there
are relations between topic (or comment) parts of the adjacent
sentences and these relations are manifested by word repetition.
We represent topic and comment parts of a sentence by bag-ofwords. In order to capture the topic-comment relation, we calculate
the similarity between them. We propose to use term and noun
based similarities. Since the frequencies of TT, TC, CT and CC
differ, it seems reasonable to weight the inter-sentence relationship
between topic and comment. Thus, we compute the score between
two adjacent sentences si−1 and si as the weighted cosine similarity
between them:

STATE OF THE ART

Current methods to evaluate readability are based on the familiarity of terms and syntax complexity [8]. Word complexity may
be estimated by humans [7, 14, 29] or according to its length [30].
Researches also propose to use language models [8, 27]. Usually
assessors assign a score to the readability of a text in some range [1].
Syntactical errors, unresolved anaphora, redundant information
and coherence influence readability and therefore the score may depend on the number of these mistakes [26]. BLEU and edit distance
may be applied for relevance judgment as well as for readability
evaluation. These metrics are semi-automatic because they require
a gold standard. Another set of methods is based on syntax analysis
which may be combined with statistics (e.g. sentence length, depth
of a parse tree, omission of personal verbs, rate of prepositional
phrases, noun and verb groups) [6, 25, 32, 33], but they remain
suitable only for the readability evaluation of a particular sentence
and, therefore, cannot be used for assessing extracts. Lapata applies
the greedy algorithm maximizing the total probability on a text
corpus as well as using a specific ordering to verb tenses [18]. Louis
and Nenkova use a hidden Markov model in which the coherence
between adjacent sentences is viewed as transition rules between
different topics [23]. Barzilay and Lapata introduce an entity grid
model where sentences are mapped into discourse entities with
their grammatical roles [2]. Entity features are used to compute
the probability of transitions between adjacent sentences. Then
machine learning classifiers are applied. Elsner and Charniak add
co-reference features [10]. Lin et al. ameliorate the model by discourse relations [21]. The entity grid model and its extensions
require syntactical parsing. The disadvantages of these models are
data sparsity, domain dependence and computational complexity.
The closest work to ours is [12] that proposes an automatic approach for SO assessment where the similarity between adjacent
sentences is used as a measure of text coherence. However, it assigns equal scores to initial and inverse SO due to the symmetric
similarity measure. In contrast, our topic-comment based method
assigns higher score to the text in Example 1.2 than 1.1.

TOPIC-COMMENT STRUCTURE FOR SO

Although it is not the core element of our method, in order to better
understand the topic-comment structure of texts of different genres,
we manually examined 10 documents randomly chosen from three
datasets (30 texts in total): (1) Wikipedia; (2) TREC Robust1 ; (3)
TREC WT10G (for collection details see Section 4). We looked at
topic-topic (TT), comment-topic (CT), topic-comment (TC) and
comment-comment (CC) inter-sentence relations in the texts, i.e.
how frequently a topic (or a comment) of a clause became a topic (or
a comment) in posterior clauses. We found that for all collections,
the most frequent relation is TT, then follows CT. TT+CT compose
more than 65% of the relationships that we found, whatever the
collection is; it is more than 80% for Wikipedia. CC is more rare
and TC is the most uncommon relation, especially in Wikipedia.
This preliminary analysis convinced us that using the topiccomment structure could be useful to evaluate readability and that
weighting these relations could be a good cue. However, for a
scalable method the text structure has to be extracted or annotated

EVALUATION

We conducted two series of experiments. For the first evaluation,
we used three datasets: (1) Wikipedia dump, (2) TREC Robust,
and (3) WT10G. The first dataset is a cleaned English Wikipedia

XML dump of 2012 without notes, history and bibliographic references [3]. We selected 32,211 articles retrieved by the search engine
Terrier2 for the queries from INEX/CLEF Tweet Contextualization
Track 2012-2013 [3]. TREC (Text Retrieval Conference) Robust
dataset is an unspammed collection of news articles from The Financial Times 1991-1994, Federal Register 1994, Foreign Broadcast
Information Service, and The LA Times [31]. We used 193,022 documents retrieved for 249 topics from the Robust dataset. In contrast,
WT10G is a snapshot of 1997 of Internet Archive with documents
in HTML format, some of which are spam [16]. We retrieved 88,879
documents for 98 topics from TREC Web track 2000-2001. Documents from Robust and WT10G may contain spelling or other
errors.
As the first baseline we used a probabilistic graphic model proposed in [18] hereinafter referred to as Lapata. Because of page
number constraints, we are not detailing this method in this paper.
The probabilities were learned from the Wikipedia dataset. For
evaluation we calculated text score as the average score between
the adjacent sentences. The second baseline TSP is a special case of
our approach with equal weights for all relations. We also examined
a variant of this method where the similarity is based on noun only
(TSPNoun). We estimated the text coherence as the average cosine
similarity between the neighboring sentences.
As in [2, 9, 20, 21, 23], we compare scores assigned to initial
documents and the same documents but with randomly permuted
sentences. This pairwise evaluation approach was justified in [21].
As in previous approaches, we assumed that the best SO is produced by a human and a good metric should reflect that by assigning
higher score to initial SO. Besides, we hypothesized that a good
metric has small degradation of results provoked by small permutation in SO and greater rate of shuffling provokes larger effect
since the obtained order is remoter from the human-made one.
Therefore, as in [12], we consider the following types of datasets:
(1) Source collection (O), (2) Rn-collection (Rn), (3) R-collection
(R). R-collection is derived from the source collection by shuffling
all sentences within each document. Rn-collection is generated
from the source collection by a random shift of n sentences within
each document. We used R1 and R2 collections. The introduction
of transitional Rn-collections differs from the approaches used in
[2, 9, 20, 21, 23].
We calculated system accuracy which shows the number of
times a system prefers the original order over its permutation divided by the total number of test pairs.
This approach for metric evaluation is completely automatic and
requires only a text corpus.
We conducted the second set of experiments on two corpora that
are widely used for SO assessment: (1) airplane Accidents from
the National Transportation Safety Board and (2) articles about
Earthquakes from the North American News Corpus [9, 21, 23].
Each of these corpora has 100 original texts and for each document 20 permutations (2000 in total). We compared our accuracy results with those reported in the literature, namely entity
grid models (Content + Egrid, Content + HMM-prodn, Content + HMM-d-seq, Egrid + HMM-prodn, Egrid + HMM-d-seq,

Egrid + Content + HMM-prodn, Egrid + Content + HMM-dseq, Egrid + Content + HMM-prodn + HMM-d-seq)3 , discourse
relation based approaches (Type+Arg+Sal,Arg+Sal, Type+Sal,
Type+Arg, Baseline+Type+Arg+Sal)4 , probabilistic content model
(Probabilistic content)5 and topic based model (Topic-relaxed)5 .

In Table 1, O, R, R1 and R2 refer to the initial sentence order and
the permutations described above and O > /< /= R• shows the
proportion of times where initial order was scored higher/lower/equally than/to permuted text for the best set of parameter values
w t t = 0.25, wct = 0.5, w t c = 0.75, and wcc = 1. Topic-comment
term based method is denoted by TopCom. For all collections
according to the number of times where the original order was
ranked higher than the shuffled one O > R, the topic-comment
approach outperformed the simple similarity-based metrics and
Lapata’s baseline. Smaller permutations in sentence order provoke
smaller changes in the score. In general noun-based similarity is less
accurate than all term based methods. It could be caused by lower
probability of non-zero similarity between the adjacent sentences.
However, both topic-comment based methods showed better results
than their analogues that do not consider text information structure.
We varied the coefficients (w t t , wct , w t c , wcc ) ∈ {0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1}4
on the Wikipedia collection. Figure 1 visualizes the correlation between the number of times where the initial document is preferred
to shuffled one O > R and each coefficient with the fixed values of
others. Smaller values of w t t , and wct refer to higher O > R, while
better results correspond to higher w t c and wcc .

we obtained the results comparable with the state of the art. For the
Earthquakes articles, the accuracy of our system is slightly lower.
It can be explained by the following facts: (1) models are trained
and tested separately for each dataset [9, 21, 23]; (2) datasets are
very homogeneous (some articles are similar up to 90% of words)
and, as noted in [9], very constrained in terms of subject and style.
In contrast, the coefficients for our method were learned from the
Wikipedia collection. This proves that our metric is general and not
restricted by a collection but it demonstrates the results comparable
with the state of the art machine learning based approaches.

CONCLUSIONS

We introduced a novel self-sufficient metric for SO assessment
based on topic-comment structure. It has linear complexity and
requires only POS-tagging. We evaluated our method on three test
collections where it demonstrated high accuracy and significantly
outperformed similarity-based baselines as well as a transition
probability based approach. The evaluation results allow drawing
conclusions that (1) topic-comment methods are more effective
than simple similarity based approaches; (2) in general, noun-based
similarity is less accurate. In contrast to the state of the art approaches, our method is general and not restricted by a collection
but it demonstrates comparable results. One of the promising direction of the future work is the integration of co-reference resolution,
synonyms and IDF. Another possible improvement is applying syntactic parsing and linguistic templates for topic-comment structure
extraction.
