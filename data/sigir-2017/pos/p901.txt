ABSTRACT

their components) the system effect can be sub-divided into system
components in order to better understand system behavior [3].
However, at least one “ingredient” is missing from consideration:
the collections of documents that are an integral part of the evaluation paradigm. Past work studied how sub-corpora impact IR
effectiveness [13] and how collection size and the choice of documents influenced the way that a test collection ranked one retrieval
system relative to another [7]. Both these studies highlighted the
importance of sub-corpora to system performance but they did not
incorporate the sub-corpus effect into a wider model:

Understanding the factors comprising IR system effectiveness is of
primary importance to compare different IR systems. Effectiveness
is traditionally broken down, using ANOVA, into a topic and a
system effect but this leaves out a key component of our evaluation
paradigm: the collections of documents. We break down effectiveness into topic, system and sub-corpus effects and compare it to the
traditional break down, considering what happens when different
evaluation measures come into play. We found that sub-corpora
are a significant effect. The consideration of which allows us to be
more accurate in estimating what systems are significantly different. We also found that the sub-corpora affect different evaluation
measures in different ways and this may impact on what systems
are considered significantly different.

effectiveness score = topic effect + system effect + sub-corpus effect
By integrating topic, system, and sub-corpus effects into the one
model, comparisons can be made between the magnitude of the
effects and, potentially, significant differences between systems can
be more accurately calculated.
This paper addresses two research questions:

CCS CONCEPTS
•Information systems →Evaluation of retrieval results; Test
collections;

RQ1 what is the impact of considering sub-corpora in an effectiveness model?
RQ2 how do different evaluation measures behave with respect
to effectiveness models including sub-corpus effects?

INTRODUCTION

Studying the effectiveness of Information Retrieval (IR) systems is
a core area of investigation, the main goal of which is to compare
different IR systems in a robust and repeatable way. Commonly, IR
system effectiveness is broken down as

METHODOLOGY

A General Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) [11] explains the variation
of a dependent variable (“Data”) in terms of a controlled variation
of independent variables (“Model”) in addition to a residual uncontrolled variation (“Error”): Data = Model + Error. In GLMM terms,
ANalysis Of VAriance (ANOVA) attempts to explain data (dependent
variable scores) in terms of the experimental conditions (the model)
and an error component. Typically, ANOVA is used to determine
under which condition dependent variables differ and what proportion of variation can be attributed to differences between specific
conditions, as defined by the independent variable(s).
The experimental design determines how to compute the model
and estimate its parameters. It is possible to have an independent
measures design where different subjects participate in different experimental conditions (factors) or a repeated measures design, where
each subject participates in all experimental conditions (factors). A
final distinction is between crossed/factorial designs – where every
level of one factor is measured in combination with every level of
the other factors – and nested designs, where levels of a factor are
grouped within each level of another nesting factor.
The traditional crossed repeated measures two-way ANOVA
design, used in past work [1, 14], breaks down effectiveness into a
topic and a system effect:

effectiveness score = topic effect + system effect
The topic effect was shown to be greater than the system effect using
a two-way ANOVA to decompose effectiveness as above [1, 14].
The decomposition allowed simultaneous multiple comparisons of
IR systems on TREC data, determining which were significantly
better than others.
To improve the estimation of the system effect, you need to add
components to the above model. For example, [10] showed that a
topic*system interaction improved the estimation but the reported
experiments relied on simulated data. Using a Grid of Points (GoP)
approach (i.e. IR systems originated by a factorial combination of

is an unbiased estimator of the variance components associated
with the sources of variation in the design, where F f act is the Fstatistic and d f f act are the degrees of freedom for the factor while
N is the total number of samples. The common rule of thumb [11]
when classifying ω̂ 2hf act i effect size is: > 0.14 is a large size effect,
0.06–0.14 is a medium size effect, and 0.01–0.06 is a small size effect.
Negative ω̂ 2hf act i values are considered as zero.
In experimentation, a Type I error occurs if a true null hypothesis
is rejected. The probability of such an error is α. The chances of
making a Type I error for a series of comparisons is greater than the
error rate for a single comparison. If we consider C comparisons, the
probability of at least one Type I error is 1−(1−α)C , which increases
with the number of comparisons. Type I errors are controlled by
applying the Tukey Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test [5]
with a significance level α = 0.05. Tukey’s method is used in
ANOVA to create confidence intervals for all pairwise differences
between factor levels, while controlling the family error rate. Two
levels u and v of a factor are considered significantly different when

and split collection (i.e. sub-corpora) we can understand changes
to effectiveness between these two collection conditions.
We also explore a crossed repeated measures three-way ANOVA
design, which breaks down effectiveness into a topic, system, and
sub-corpus effect, as shown in Figure 1:

We used the TREC Adhoc T07 and T08 collections: 528,155 documents made up of four TIPSTER sub-corpora: Foreign Broadcast
Information Service (TIPFBIS, 130,471 documents); Federal Register (TIPFR, 55,630 documents); Financial Times (TIPFT, 210,158
documents); and Los Angeles Times (TIPLA, 131,896 documents).
T07 and T08 provide 50 topics: 351-400 and 401-450, as well as
binary relevance judgments drawn from a pool depth of 100; 103
and 129 runs were submitted to T07 and T08, respectively.
We split the T07 and T08 runs on the four sub-corpora by keeping
the retrieved documents that belong to each sub-corpus. We applied
the same split procedure to relevance judgments. This caused some
topics to have no relevant documents on some sub-corpora, which
suggests some kind of bias during topic creation and/or relevance
assessment. Consequently, we kept only the topics that have at
least one relevant document on each sub-corpus. This left us with
22 topics for T07 and 15 topics for T08. We used eight evaluation
measures: Average Precision (AP), P@10; Rprec, Rank-Biased Precision (RBP) [8], Normalized Discounted Cumulated Gain (nDCG) [6],
nDCG@20, Expected Reciprocal Rank (ERR) [2], and Twist [4].

where: Yi jk is the effectiveness score of the i-th subject in the j-th
and k-th factors; µ ··· is the grand mean; τi = µ i ·· − µ ··· is the effect
of the i-th subject, i.e. a topic, where µ i ·· is the mean of the i-th
subject; α j = µ ·j · − µ ··· is the effect of the j-th factor, i.e. a system,
where µ ·j · is the mean of the j-th factor; βk = µ ··k − µ ··· is the
effect of the k-th factor, i.e. a sub-corpus, where µ ··k is the mean
of the k-th factor; (α β)jk is the interaction between systems and
sub-corpora; finally, εi jk is the error committed by the model in
predicting the effectiveness score of the i-th subject in the two
factors j and k.
We compare the GLMM models in eqs (1) and (2). Note, when we
apply eq (1) to sub-corpora, we use the design shown in Figure 1 but
omit the βk sub-corpus effect. Thus, we obtain a two-way ANOVA
where we have more replicates for each (topic, system) pair, one
for each sub-corpus.
An ANOVA test outcome indicates, for each factor, the Sum of
Squares (SS), the Degrees of Freedom (DF), the Mean Squares (MS), the
F statistics, and the p-value of that factor, to determine significance.
We are also interested in determining the proportion of variance
that is due to a particular factor: i.e. we estimate its effect-size
measure or Strength of Association (SOA), which is a “standardized
index and estimates a parameter that is independent of sample size
and quantifies the magnitude of the difference between populations
or the relationship between explanatory and response variables” [9].

the size of the topic effect. The Tukey HSD test indicates that
1,872 out of 8,256 (22.67%) possible system pairs are significantly
different with 64 out of 129 (49.61%) systems being in the top-group.
Measuring on sub-corpora tends to decrease the size of the system effect relative to the topic effect. More pairs of significantly
different systems were found with fewer in the top group.
Figure 2(d) plots the AP marginal mean of systems on the whole
TIPSTER collection (black dashed line) and on the sub-corpora (red
solid line) together with their confidence intervals (shaded). The AP
values of systems change, but system ranking is not too dissimilar,
as suggested by the Kendall’s correlation τ = 0.8238. We can see
how the use of sub-corpora makes the confidence intervals smaller,
suggesting more accuracy, as supported also by the outcomes of
the Tukey HSD test.
Figure 2(c) shows eq (2) applied to the four sub-corpora. The SS of
the topic and system effects is the same as in the case of Figure 2(b)

system pairs are significantly different with 71 out of 129 (55.04%)
systems being in the top-group; this is coherent with the reduction
of the MS er r or term which, being the other factors constant, makes
the |t | statistics in the Tukey HSD test bigger, thus detecting more
significant differences.
Figure 2(e) shows the main effects plot for the sub-corpus effect:
sub-corpora affect system effectiveness. Figure 2(f) plots the interaction effects for the sub-corpus*system effect where each line
represents a different system. Even if, in the case of AP, the effect is not significant, we can note how sub-corpora affect systems
differently. For example, the general trend is that systems have
lower effectiveness on the TIPFR sub-corpus, even if a few systems
behave the opposite way; similarly, TIPFT is the sub-corpus that
results in highest effectiveness but with some exceptions.

Table 1 shows eq (2) applied to the four sub-corpora for T07 and
T08 for all evaluation measures. The topic effect is significant and
large in all cases while the system effect is a significant medium
size effect in about half of the cases and large in the other half.
The sub-corpora are always a significant effect with small or
medium size, except for RBP and ERR on T08 for which it is a
large size. On T07, the sub-corpus effect is always smaller than
the system effect, on T08 the sub-corpus effect is bigger than the
system effect for P@10, RBP, and ERR. The sub-corpus*system
interaction effect is generally not significant, with the exception
of nDCG and nDCG@20 on T07 and nDCG and ERR on T08 for
which it is significant though small.
Table 1 shows the Kendall’s τ correlations between the rankings
of systems using eq (1) on the whole TIPSTER collection and eq (2)
on the four sub-corpora. The rankings are generally correlated,
indicating a good agreement between the two approaches, even
if there are some cases where correlation drops, namely P@10,
nDCG@20, and ERR, on T08 and nDCG@20 on T07.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

We find that sub-corpora are a significant effect on system effectiveness. While past work has indicated such an effect exists, to the best
of our knowledge, this is the first time such an effect has been integrated into a effectiveness model and effect sizes compared to other
known factors. We find that different evaluation measures are affected in different ways by sub-corpora, which may impact on what
systems are considered significantly different to each other. We
found that ranking systems using sub-corpora reasonably agrees
with ranking systems with respect to a whole collection but using
the information about sub-corpora allows a more accurate estimation of which systems are significantly different.
This is initial work. We recognize that the number of topics in
our collections is small. We next plan to understand the impact of
different kinds of sub-corpora. We also plan to extend the present
methodology to study the impact of different collections on system
performance rather than sub-corpora within one collection.
