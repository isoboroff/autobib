ABSTRACT

factor for recommendation tasks, users’ occupation plays an important role in user profile. We design a new approach to tackle
the occupation prediction problem only from public trajectory data,
i.e., SPOT(Selecting occuPations frOm Trajectories). We provide
two cases of users’ check-in activities in Figure 1. It is vivid that
different occupational categories users favor varying places.

With the pervasive availability of smart devices, billions of users’
trajectories are recorded and collected. The aggregated human
behaviors reveal users’ interests and characteristics, becoming invaluable to reflect their demographic preference, i.e., gender, age,
marital status and even personality, occupation. Occupation profiling from trajectory data is an attractive option for advertisement
targeting and other applications, without severe privacy concerns.
However, it carries great difficulties in sparsity and vagueness.
This paper proposes a novel approach, i.e., SPOT (Selecting occuPation frOm Trajectories). We first carefully analyze and report the
trajectory pattern variance of different occupational categories in a
large real dataset. And then we design novel ways to extract users
content, location and transition preference, and finally illustrate a
comprehensive occupation prediction method, Continuous Conditional Random Fields (C-CRF) based prediction model. Empirical
studies confirm that the new approach works surprisingly well,
and it shows the discriminative power of trajectory data to reveal
occupational preference.

Specifically, we consider the occupation prediction task as a
global ranking problem and formalize a Continuous Conditional
Random Fields (C-CRF) based model [8] to well fuse the multi-type
trajectory features. We dive into the check-in data and select three
kind of trajectory features from users’ check-in logs based on their
predicative power on revealing user’s occupation preference: a).
content features, extracted from the text messages constantly posted
by users; b). location features, including user’s check in POIs and
their semantic descriptions; c). mobility features, indicating the
users’ moving patterns between different locations.
We systematically evaluate our prediction model SPOT on a
large real-world trajectory dataset, and the prediction results are
promising. SPOT opens a new angle on inferring user occupations
based on trajectory logs collected from smart phone devices. It
illustrates that trajectory features are able to uncover the relation
between user and occupation from a new way.
The contribution of this work can be summarized as follows: a).
We collect, process and enrich a public trajectory dataset, which
consists of real users’ check-in logs, corresponding place annotations and their social network, occupation information. b). We
present a new occupation prediction method SPOT, which combines the trajectory features in a novel way and paves the path for
further trajectory inference. c). We conduct an extensive study
and evaluation on the real large dataset. It not only confirms the
improvement of our proposed SPOT approach but also provides
new insights into the trajectory data analysis. d). Besides the predication, the result in this work indicates that, the information posted
by users would directly or indirectly result in information leakage,

INTRODUCTION

User profiling, i.e., demographic attribute inference, is a profound
problem in many user-oriented surveillance, society research and
business applications, since precise user understanding is essential
for potential consumer targeting and content delivery. Many researchers have devoted to the task of mining latent facets about
users, from simple attributes like gender, age and education background to more complicated ones such as interest, personality and
political polarity [7, 14]. The stunning growth of social media
ignites the digital tracing tornado of users’ life record, and user
profiling attracts more attention than ever before. Recent work
includes the profile attribute inference from micro-blog posts, purchase transactions, social network and cellular data [1, 2, 11].
In this work, we focus on a more challenging problem, i.e., occupation prediction. As a critical demographic attribute and a crucial

and there is a high probability users’ occupation to be successfully
predicted. This paves a way for trajectory record anonymity.

in the form of heat maps like Figure 1. The distribution of check-in
locations varies from occupation to occupation as well as from city
to city. In this work, its discriminative power will benefit to the
occupation prediction task.
Mobility Feature. Human trajectory is intimately intertwined
with highly personal behaviors and characteristics. We extract
trajectory patterns from users’ trajectories to continue to explore
the discriminative power of mobile behaviors. Unlike trajectory
record we defined before, a trajectory pattern is a sequence of POI
categories. For example, a 2-step trajectory pattern [office building,
residential quarter] corresponds to the behavior that visiting from
the office building to a residential quarter. This work conducts
sequence pattern mining to extract trajectory patterns as mobility
feature.
After analyzing trajectory patterns, we find that besides some
typical patterns like transitions within residential districts or airports which are frequent in all occupational categories, each category have their own distinct patterns. According to our statistics,
sport athletes have a unique pattern [hospital, residential quarter]
from which we can speculate that they go to hospitals due to injuries
more often than people in other occupational categories. Moreover,
we find that mobility features and location features could complement each other and provide a more comprehensive presentation
of user behaviors.

2 TRAJECTORY FEATURES FOR
OCCUPATION PREDICTION
In this work, we annotate a geo-tagged micro-blog post as a trajectory record. It is defined as a tuple r = u, p, w, c where: u is the
user id, p is a two-dimensional vector representing the geographical
location of the check-in place, w is the check-in time and c is the
text content of the record.
Given a set of trajectory records R x = {r 1 , r 2 , ..., r n } of user u x ,
we generate a set of trajectories Tx = {t 1 , t 2 , ..., tk } where each
trajectory tk is composed of several trajectory records r k 1r k2 ...r kn
and satisfies:
(1) ∀i < j, r ki w < r k j w;
(2) all trajectory records are created on the same day;
(3) there is no longer trajectory of user u x that contains all
trajectory records of tk and also satisfies condition (1) and
(2).
Figure 2 shows a trajectory, with several trajectory records r 2r 3r 4 .
User trajectories reflect users’ moving pattern in daily life and
the transition log provides clues for inferring users’ occupation
categories.

OCCUPATION PREDICTION APPROACH

Next we illustrate our proposed model SPOT (Selecting occuPation
frOm Trajectories), which combines multi-types of trajectory features and delivers the predicted occupation results. We regard the
prediction task as a global ranking problem and present a Continuous Conditional Random Fields (C-CRF) based model [8] to fuse the
features depicted in previous sections and generate comprehensive
preference scores of users on occupational categories.

Now we continue to discuss the chosen three kinds of features
extracted from trajectories, i.e., content features, location features
and trajectory ones.
Content Feature. The content features are extracted from the
short text messages posted by users in each trajectory record. It is
intuitive to find that users of different occupations tend to talk about
different topics and favor diverse words in their postings. Based on
this natural motivation, we label each occupational category with
representative terms, according to the term statistics in different
occupation categories.
It is vivid that, for each occupational category, there are always
a number of particular words which take a high probability in this
certain occupation but a very low probability in others. For instance,
users who work in the field of sport use words like women football,
fencing, combat, etc about thirty times more frequently.
Location Feature. Geographical location usually reflects human socioeconomic activities, e.g., living, working, entertaining,
etc. Thus location feature is intimately bounded up with occupation
prediction. People of the same occupational category may usually
appear in some specific functional areas in the city. For example, IT
practitioners have a higher chance to visit high-technology business
regions like Silicon Valley in San Francisco Bay Area, Zhongguancun in Beijing, etc. Therefore we can visualize check-in locations

Figure 3: Model Structure of SPOT
Conceptually, in this global ranking task, we assume that the
users in same occupational categories have similar characteristics
among multi-type features. SPOT is a graphical model as depicted
in Figure 3. Let X = {U , O, C, R} denote all objects related to our prediction task including users U = {u 1 , u 2 , ..., u M }, occupational categories O = {o 1 , o 2 , ..., o N }, checked-in activities C = {c 1 , c 2 , ..., c L },
and their relationships R = {(ui , o j , cl )}. Also, we define a matrix
E = {ei j } to denote the preference score of user ui on occupational
category o j , and the preference score ei j with the highest value
for user ui implies that ui most likely belongs to the occupational
category o j . Therefore, the occupation prediction task is transformed into finding the occupational preference score matrix E that

maximizes the appearance of E given all current objects in X , i.e.,
E = argmax Pr (E|X ) = argmax Pr (E|U , O, C, R).

The C-CRF model uses the potential function and the cliques in the
model structure to define the conditional probability. According to
a prior study [8], by using the exponential potential function and
introducing feature functions, it provides a way to estimate such
probability as

where α is a K 1 -dimension parameter vector, hk is vertex feature
function that evaluates the dependency between the preference

parameter vector, дk is edge feature function that evaluates the
similarity relation between two preference ranking scores based
on the k-th relevant factor, and Z (x ) is a normalization function to
ensure the probability is correctly defined where

We first introduce the vertex feature functions hk defined on
cliques {ei j , ui , o j }. The relevance of multi-type trajectory features
to the users will directly influence their preference ranking score
on occupational categories. We define this kind feature function
hk (ei, j , x) as
hk (ei, j , x) = −(ei, j − tk (x i, j , ei, j )) 2 ,

EMPIRICAL STUDY

To demonstrate the advantage of the SPOT approach, we conduct
extensive empirical studies. Here we collect a large dataset of real
users’ check-in logs from a micro-blog platform in China, i.e., Sina
Weibo, and also resort to Baidu Map1 and OpenStreetMap2 APIs to
supplement the check-in location’s description. The supplementary
location dataset serves as a complement to the original Sina Weibo
dataset, and we note that all data we collected is through Open API
or publicly available on web sites, which does not raise privacy
concern.
We choose a subset of around 15,000 verified active users, who
have around 640,000 check-in records and 17,000 POI (Points of
Interest) locations. Verified users are a specific category of users
in Weibo platform, who have veritable occupation information,
verified by Sina staff. This facilitates the ground truth verification
in most of the user profile research. We also fetch the users’ social
network connections from the Weibo site, in order to study their
social interactions.

Users of top five occupation categories in Weibo dataset are used
for evaluation in this work and their distributions are provided
in Table 1. We conduct a five-fold cross validation pipeline for
performance evaluation and use 80% users for training and 20%
for testing. Common evaluation metrics are chosen to evaluate
our model, i.e., accuracy, macro-averaging precision, recall and
F-measure respectively. We compare the proposed approach with
the following baseline methods:
- Individual Features: Content, location and mobility based
ones are included. These baselines only take one kind
features as input. They are also used to test the contribution
of every kind features.
- Network Features: We resort to a graph embedding method
to transform the social network graph into low dimensional
representation and conduct graph classification to predict
users’ occupational categories.
- Ensemble: We choose a stacking ensemble method [12],
which trains a sub-level learner to combine the predictions
from other primary learning algorithms for multi-type
features.

where tk denotes the influence of the k-th relevant factor (i.e., the
content, location or mobility features) to the preference ranking
score ei, j which can be usually generated from a supervised learner.
Then, we introduce edge feature functions дk defined on cliques
{ei j , el j , ui , ul , o j }. We conduct a round of ranking based on the
similarity information between multi-type features. Here the similarity between any two relevant factors in a certain type of feature
are supposed to be given. We define this kind feature function
дk (ei, j , el, j , x) as
1
дk (ei, j , el, j , x) = − Si,l,k (ei, j − el, j ) 2 ,
(5)
2
where Si,l,k = sk (x i,k , xl,k ) denotes similarity between user ui
and user ul on the k-th relevant factor which can be calculated by
cosine similarity of the raw trajectory features (i.e., the content,
location and mobility features), and the larger Si,l,k is, the more
similar users’ preference are.
The inference process of SPOT is to obtain parameter {α k , βk }
given training dataset D = (X , E) = ({U , O, C, R}, E). Since we are
only interested in ranking occupations, so the inference process
can be simplified. In our work, we follow the methodology applied
in [5], enumerate the combination of parameters, and select the
one that makes the model obtain the maximal average precision of
occupation prediction task.

The prediction performance of our method and other baselines
are shown in Figure 4. It is shown that the proposed SPOT approach
gains an accuracy around 61.44% and outperforms other baselines
on all evaluation metrics. For the individual features, content features perform the best, with an accuracy around 53.50%, since it
is rich and contains lots of descriptive words. Other two features
are not very high (location feature is around 36.83% and mobility
feature is around 30.84% ). The ensemble of three trajectory features
has an improved performance. Network feature performs not well
since the network information of selected users are very sparse.

interests on some extents. Speaking of the prediction task on top
of trajectory data, identifying semantically-meaningful locations
helps a lot to improve the inference performance [13, 14].

In this work, we explore the occupation prediction problem from
check-in trajectory data, and present a comprehensive solution, i.e.,
SPOT (Selecting occuPation frOm Trajectories) to predict the users’
occupation categories. The proposed SPOT approach combines
content, location and mobility features, and its performance has
been verified by the real dataset. The proposed method is promising
and still having some improvement space. We are conducting the
trajectory cognition platform to include more external features
and provide insights into the correlation between users’ trajectory
activities and latent characteristics.

Compared with the ensemble method, SPOT has significant improvements on recall, indicating that SPOT is preferable to combine
multi-type features.
To validate SPOT’s performance, we continue to dive into the
prediction details. In Table 2, we show the distribution of identified
occupational categories. Each entry r i j lying in row-i and column-j
means the ratio of the users in occupational category oi being identified as category o j . To make the result more comprehensive, we
mark the largest entry of each row using a different color shade. The
entries on diagonal line are marked in a emphasized color, suggesting that the probability of any category being identified correctly is
larger than being identified as other occupation categories in error.
In addition, the distribution is affected by the sample quantity of
each occupation category. The prediction details prove the usefulness of SPOT. It not only provides satisfying overall accuracy but
also achieves fine balance amongst different categories.

RELATED LITERATURE

The first aspect related to this work is user profiling which aims to
infer attributes of users from social media or other kinds of data.
Users’ online activities provide many clues for profile extraction
and various data have been used for inferring user attributes including cellular network data [1], purchase data [11], and social media
interaction data [7], etc. As for occupation inference, it is more
difficult than other attributes due to its category complexity and
feature representation diversification. Previous works mainly use
the information of neighbors to construct classification methods for
prediction [4, 6]. However it may bring up privacy concern. Differently, our proposed method utilizes the recent emerging trajectory
data and the corresponding annotated rich auxiliary information
to improve the prediction performance.
And the second aspect is check-in behavior mining. The recent
flourishing of mobile devices brings up a rich set of users’ check-in
data. Empirical analysis of user check-in and trajectory activities
were extensively investigated [3, 9, 10]. These recent studies have
shown that mobility is correlated to social status and reflects users’
