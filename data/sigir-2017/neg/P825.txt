ABSTRACT

In this paper we study the correlation between two critical factors in MSNs. The former is a special type of online behaviors,
called online social behavior, i.e., the social-relationship networking among users. The latter is an offline behavior, i.e., the spatial
mobility pattern of users. The correlation between them naturally
comes into play when implementing some social-relevant studies on MSNs, e.g., improving information propagation on MSNs
and making recommendations among friends with location-based
services. Modeling such a correlation is the motivation of this work.
More specifically, we investigate the spatial distribution of users’
followers in MSNs. Based on the check-in records of MSN users,
we propose a model, called neighborhood-cardinality-based model
(NCBM), to describe the spatial distribution of an MSN user’s followers. We evaluate the proposed model by simulating the followership formation process based on two real-life geolocation
datasets: Brightkite and Gowalla, with comparisons to the wellknown distance-based model [3] and rank-based model [4]. Our
experimental results indicate that the proposed model successfully
emulates the social formation mechanism from the perspective of
users’ geographical distribution.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we
introduce the directly relevant studies. In Section 3, we present
the features of mobile social networks based on observing two
real-life geolocation datasets. We model the followership formation
in MSNs in Section 4, and give the corresponding evaluation in
Section 5. Finally, we draw a conclusion in Section 6.

In this paper we aim at addressing the correlation between two critical factors in mobile social networks (MSNs): the social-relationship
networking among users and the spatial mobility pattern of users.
Specifically, we investigate the impact of users’ spatial distribution
on their social relationship formation in MSNs. Based on the geolocation data (check-in records) and social relation data of MSN
users, we propose a model, called neighborhood-cardinality-based
model (NCBM), to describe this impact by taking into account both
the multiple home-points/hotspots property of spatial mobility and
the long-tailed social relationship degree distribution of MSN users.
We define a fundamental quantity for each user, i.e., the so-called
neighborhood cardinality, to measure how many and how often
other MSN users visit his nearby area with a given range. The
core of NCBM is a principle: The probability that a user, say u, is
followed by another user, say v, obeys a power law distribution of
the neighborhood cardinality of user u. The proposed formation
model is evaluated on two large check-in datasets: Brightkite and
Gowalla. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed formation model provides a useful paradigm for capturing the correlation
between MSN users’ mobility patterns and social relationships.

INTRODUCTION

RELATED WORK

Some excellent studies have investigated the correlation between
the spatial distribution and social relationship formation of users
in online social networks. Kleinberg [3] proposed a distance-based
social model relating geographical distance and social followership.
The probability of a user following another user is inversely proportional to the power of the geographical distance between these
two users. In [4], Liben-Nowell et al. proposed a rank-based model
where the probability of following a particular person is inversely
proportional to the power of the number of closer people. They
pointed out that the distance-based models neglect the impacts of
the nonuniform distribution of the network users. In [6], Wang et al.
presented a population-based model by modifying the rank-based
model [4]. They introduced an effective tool called anchor point
to separate the followership dependency on users’ geographical
distribution. Furthermore, the anchor points can also connect the
uncertain geographical distribution of the users and their followers.
All the studies above focus on modeling the social relationship formation for online social networks with static users. However, those

Mobile Internet (MI) provides a way for users to access the cyber space anytime and anywhere. It actually serves as a seamless
pipeline connecting different spaces, e.g., physical space and cyber
space. When daily social activities of people are extended to the
cyber space via MI, a promising MI application emerges, i.e., mobile
social networks (MSNs). In MSNs, users’ behavior usually takes
place in a blended form consisting of online behavior and offline
behavior. The correlations between them play an important role in
social-relevant research on MSNs, [2, 7].

Next, we investigate the social impacts of multiple homepoints
(frequently visited points) of users. An MSN user usually has multiple centers, [1]. An interesting problem is whether there is some
correlation between the visiting frequency at a center/homepoint
(the number of visits on this position) and the social relationship
formation. To address this issue, we check the correlation between
the proportion of the followers that can be clustered to a certain
center and the proportion of the check-in quantity belonging to
this center. The statistic result shows that the follower proportion
is positively relevant to the check-in proportion. Due to limited
space, we remove these statistical figures. Therefore, we summarize
these results as the third feature.
Feature 3. For any user, the number of his followers belonging
to a given center is positively relevant to the visiting frequency at
this center; and the number of followers belonging to every center
approximately follows a Zipf’s distribution.

MODELING USERS’ FOLLOWERSHIP
FORMATION BASED ON FOOTPRINT
4.1 Geographical Distribution of Users’

models cannot apply to mobile social networks with mobile users
because they do not consider the mobility of users. The geographical distribution of mobile users is usually necessary for modeling
the social formation in mobile cases.

3

In [1], Multi-center Gaussian Model was introduced to model the
users’ spatial distribution in Gowalla and Brightkite [2].
For a given dataset, we can find the centers of each user by a
greedy clustering algorithm [1] among the check-ins due to the
Pareto principle. We scan from the most visited points/positions
and combine all other visited check-in locations, whose distance
is less than a given threshold d, from the selected point, into a
region. If the ratio of the total check-in number of this region to
the user’s total check-in amount is greater than a threshold θ , we
set these check-in positions as a region and determine its center. In
our experiment, we set θ = 0.15 and d = 5 according to the training
dataset so that most users could have several centers and users’
check-ins are grouped into their centers. Due to limited space, we
omit the detailed procedure. Please refer to Algorithm 1 in [1]. By
the chosen centers, we can estimate where the user vk tends to be
according to the probability distribution with the density function:

STATISTICAL FEATURES ON USERS’
FOLLOWERSHIPS

Before proposing the users’ followership formation model, we extract typical features of mobile social networks (MSNs) from the
observations on two datasets of real-life MSNs, i.e., Gowalla and
Brightkite [2]. Table 1 gives the description of datasets.

3.1

Degree Distribution of Followerships

We investigate the degree distributions of social relationships in
Gowalla and Brightkite datasets, respectively.
We first add up the number of users with a same outdegree,
and then gather the statistics on the outdegree distribution. As
shown in Figure 1, a long-tailed feature is captured for both datasets.
More specifically, the outdegree distributions for both datasets
approximate to the Zipf’s distribution. Furthermore, we find there
is no correlation between the degree distribution and local density
of users according to the statistics. We remove the details due to
limited space. Combining the observations above, we present the
first statistical feature of MSNs.

where the random variable X := (x, y) denotes the position of
a selected point in the deployment region, c k denotes the center
location set of user vk , c k,i denotes the location of the ith center of
user vk , Ik,i denotes the frequency of user vk ’s check-ins in center
c k,i region, Ik denotes the total check-in frequency of user vk ,
c k,i and σk,i denote the mean and variance of the Gaussian Model
of each center c k,i , |X − c k,i | represents the Euclidean distance
between point/position X and center c k,i , and the coefficient Πk
depends on c k and σ , satisfying that:

Feature 1. The number of a user’s followers approximately follows a Zipf’s distribution.

3.2

Correlation between Users’ Followership
and Footprint

We investigate the spatial distribution of users’ followers in Gowalla
and Brightkite datasets. In existing works, e.g., [4, 6], a common
approach was adopted to handle the mobility of users. It assumes
that each mobile user is staying near a center, e.g., his mostly visited
location. To the best of our knowledge, the rank-based model [4] is
the most realistic theoretical model for social relationship formation.
We include the results from [4, 6] as the second feature.
Feature 2 ([4, 6]). The probability that a user, say u, follows a
particular user, say v, is approximately inversely proportional to
the power of the number of users whose most frequent check-in
centers (MFCCs) are closer to the MFCC of v than that of u.

distribution of Gowalla and Brightkite users. To calculate each
equation above, we set the parameter γ , α, β in advance. In the
simulation process, we assign 0.7 to γ , making most of the users
having a small number of followers and some of them having many
followers. Similarly, we assign 1 to β, making that most followers
of a user are close to the centers of this user. We let α = 1, which
means that the influence of a user’s center is proportional to the
sum of check-ins in this center area. The assigned parameters are
close to the observed values obtained by the training dataset.
Based on the users’ geographical distribution, we allocate the
followers for each user in two datasets. After selecting the centers of
each user, we assign a number of followers to each user u according
to Eq.(3). The user’s degree l follows a Zipf’s distribution depending
on the number of users in each dataset. After determining the
degree l of each user u, we repeat choosing point pk on the map
according to the probability calculated by Eq.(4). For each chosen
point pk , we calculate the probability that each user appears at this
position by Eq.(1), and choose a user u ′ to be the user related to the
point pk . The point pk is chosen as an anchor point of user u, and
u ′ is chosen as a follower of user u.

Using this probability distribution, we can get the probability of
each user appearing at position pki , and sample a user vm to be the
association node with the anchor point, as the follower of user vk .

EVALUATION OF MODELS

We evaluate the proposed model on Brightkite and Gowalla dataset.
Since a user only has a few followers, it is hard to predict who is his
follower and where the followers are among all users in the dataset.
In particular, we are interested in the realistic significance of the
model, i.e., given the location distribution of each user, we aim
to generate followers for them and verify whether the statistical
properties of these generated followers accord with the reality.
To demonstrate the advantages of NCBM, we also compare the
simulation result on our model to those on the two baseline models.

The Properties of Generated Network

Figure 2 shows the degree distribution generated by NCBM. This
result actually conforms to the Feature 1 in Section 3.1. It demonstrates the effectiveness of the designed degree formation method.
Figure 3 shows the simulation result on the geographical distribution of each user center’s followership. We conclude that the
simulation result on the geographical distribution of each user center’s followership also follows a Zipf’s distribution, which demonstrates that our social formation model extremely simulates the
geographical distribution of realistic followership, validating Feature 2 mentioned in Section 3.2.

Simulation Method

To evaluate our NCBM model, we generate the followers for each
user in Gowalla and Brightkite according to the NCBM model.
In all of our simulations we only consider the users that have
at least 10 check-ins so that we can model each user’s spatial distribution with Multi-center Gaussian distribution accurately. We
use the users’ historical check-in data to model the geographical

and user v and Y denotes the probability that user u follows user v
when the distance/rank equals X . The degree distributions generated by the distance-based and rank-based models approximately
follow the Gaussian distribution, which has an obvious deviation
from Feature 1 in Section 3.1.
To evaluate the performance of the distance-based model, rankbased model and NCBM on followership geographical distribution,
we use the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root-Mean-Square
Error (RMSE) to measure how the followership geographical distribution fit a Zipf’s distribution. The smaller the MAE and RMSE are,
the better the model performs. The results show that the followership geographical distribution generated by our NCBM performs
well among these three model.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

We propose a neighborhood-cardinality-based model (NCBM) to
emulate the social relationship formation mechanism from the
perspective of users’ geographical distribution. The model takes
into account both the multiple hotspots property of spatial mobility
and the long-tailed property of relationship degree distribution. The
evaluation on real-life datasets from Brightkite and Gowalla shows
that the proposed NCBM model can capture the features of MSNs
better than the classic distance-based model and rank-based model.
The NCBM can serve as a tool linking users’ social-relationship
networking and the spatial mobility pattern and provide better
social recommendation in MSNs.
