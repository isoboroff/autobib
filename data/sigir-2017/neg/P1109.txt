ABSTRACT

books from the genres that merit special attention by the
general public from massive available books.
However, these reading lists are not adaptable to real-world
book requests in many cases. Usually the reading interests
vary from one person to another, even change temporarily from time to time. LibrartyThing.com (LT) [9] provides
users a forum to discuss their topical book requests, where
users typically describe what they are looking for, give some
examples of what they like or not. Others post their recommendations due to their reading experiences. Through
the interactions, one can have own reading list based on
the recommendations. However, the recommendation process
cannot be real-time. The topics would remain unresolved
unless someone concerns. Moreover, the quality cannot be
guaranteed because some specific topics which require professional knowledge. Consequentially, it is expected to construct
an automatic way to build a topical reading list.
Very few research has been conducted on this task. Jardine
[4] studied the task of generating reading lists for novices in a
scientific field. He proposed to combine Latent Topic Models
with Personalized PageRank and Age Adjustment to generate
reading lists of scientific papers. Ekstrand et al. [3] explored
several methods for augmenting existing collaborative and
content-based filtering to build research reading lists. These
two approaches are both focusing on scientific papers, which
contains large amount of text. For book collections, only
some professional metadata, including the title, or some
other publication information, is provided.
Social media opened up new horizons for book recommendations. On social media, book descriptions also contain a
wealth of user-generated social contents (e.g., ratings, tags
and reviews) that come from the web-described properties,
contents and attributes [11]. A public track named Social
Book Search aims at searching books from social media, e.g.
Amazon.com and the participants manage to utilize social
information appropriately to promote the performances. The
Bellot et al. [1] focused on the ratings and reviews of books and conducted a weighting function with the number of
reviews and ratings for the initial ranking score. Furthermore, Koolen et al. [8] found that indexing with useful types
of social information can help to improve search accuracy.
These approaches mainly focus on the relevance, which might
ignores other factors, e.g. popularity, overlapping.
In this paper, we propose a searching framework for generating a topical reading list through embedding various data
resources from social media to represent four designed useful

During every summer holidays, several editions of reading
lists are recommended and emerged on mass media, e.g.,
New York Times, and BBC. However, these reading lists are
built for whole people with general topics for some purposes.
What if we expect the books of a specific topic at a specific
moment? How to generate the requested reading list for our
own automatically? In this paper, we propose a searching
framework for building a topical reading list anytime, where
the Relevance (between topics and books), Quality (of books),
Timeliness (of popularities) and Diversity (of results) are
embedded into vector representations respectively based on
user-generated contents and statistics on social media. We
collected 8,197 real-world topics from 198 diverse groups on
Librarything.com. The proposed methods are evaluated on
the topic collection and the public benchmarks Social Book
Search 2012-2016 (SBS). Experimental results demonstrate
the robustness and effectiveness of our framework.

INTRODUCTION

In today’s technology-driven world, most people should make
time in their hectic schedules to read great literatures. Meanwhile, some famous media, (e.g. American Library Association,New York Times, and BBC) or some famous people, (e.g.
Bill Gates) usually recommend and generate some reading
lists for general readers, which aims to highlight outstanding

metrics: Relevance, Quality, Timeliness, and Diversity. Specifically, the Relevance stands for the relevance between topics
and recommended books, which can be computed through
the similarities between the representations of the topics and
the book contents. Moreover, the Quality reflects the opinions
of users on the recommended books, which can be accessed
through the historic statistics of the selected books. On social
media, a rating is the user’s assessment over books in terms
of quality while the reviews have various forms of comments
and discussions in which a book is evaluated. As a result,
the ratings and the historic statistics of browsing, reviewing,
reading over the whole website can be used to assess the
quality. Different from the Quality describing the popularity
of the books, the Timeliness is designed to visualize the
popularity trend at the time posting the requests, which the
statistics of the most popular books or collections can be used.
Finally, the Diversity of the recommended books is a metric
to offer a better balanced reading list to prevent overlapping
among the books. In this paper, we adopt an approach to
embed the similarities between the results, to minimize the
redundancy of the results. The embeddings of four designed
metrics are finally fed into classifiers to determine whether
to recommend a book or not.
We collected 8,197 real-world topics from 198 diverse groups which contains history, literature, fiction and other various
interest groups on Librarything.com. The proposed framework is evaluated through extensive experiments on the topic
collection as well as a 5-year (2012-16) Social Book Search
public benchmarks. Experimental results show the great performances of our framework on all datasets compared with
some state-of-the-art systems.

METHODOLOGY

The whole architecture to generate a reading list is presented in Fig. 1. Firstly keywords are extracted from topics to
generate appropriate queries for search engine to achieve
a baseline ranking result. Afterwards, we embed the four
designed factors (the Relevance, Quality, Timeliness and Diversity) into vector representations for each topic-book pair,
which is claimed as our proposed framework. Finally, softmax
is applied to learn to classify the candidate topic-book pairs
to build the reading list. In the following, the embedding
process of the four factors are introduced in detail.

3.1

Relevance Embedding

The most important factor to build a topical reading list is
to match books whose contents are relevant to the topics,
namely Relevance. The basic idea to embed the relevance is
to learn the semantic similarity of topic-book pairs with sentence models. In the following, we first describe the sentence
model for mapping topics and books to their intermediate
representations and then describe how to learn semantic
matching between them.
3.1.1 Sentence Model. We follow the approach of [10]
composed of a single wide convolutional layer followed by a
non-linearity and simple max pooling, shown in Fig. 2. The
input to the network are the sequential words appeared in
topics and books that needs to be translated into real-valued
feature vectors processed by subsequent layers of the network.
The sentences appeared in one specific field in a topic or a
book (e.g. a review for a book) are treated as a sequence of
words: [𝑤1 , 𝑤2 , · · · , 𝑤|𝑠| ] from the vocabulary list. Words are
represented by distributional vectors w ∈ R𝑑 , which can be
looked up from pre-trained word vectors. These vectors are
concatenated together into a sentence matrix S ∈𝑑×|𝑆| . To
learn the semantics of the whole sentences, the convolutional
layer is utilized to extract patterns in training instances. We
use a filter 𝑓 ∈ R𝑚 (𝑚 stands for the size of 𝑓 ) on S through
the convolution operation. As shown in Fig. 2, it slides along
the column dimension of S to produce a convonlution feature
map, in the form of a matrix 𝐶 ∈ R𝑑×|𝑠| − 𝑚 + 1. With
several filters with different sizes, a set of multiple feature
maps are generated in the convolutional layer.
The output from the convolutional layer are passed through
the pooling layer in order to aggregate the information and
reduce the representation. Several descriptions in a book (e.g.
review) or a topic (e.g. narrative) contains a wealth of useless

TASK DESCRIPTION

The task is to recommend a reading list matching the user’s
book request descriptions (known as a specific topic) posted
on the LT discussion forum. The user requests may vary from
asking for books on a particular genre, or books written in a
certain period. Two example topics from LT forum are shown
in Table 1, where the field Title is the general description
headings, while Narrative contains the first message of recommendation requests and Group simply shows the name of the
discussion group. Additionally, the date when the topic was
posted is also provided for the consideration of timeliness.
The candidate books are the collection of 2.78 million
book records which consist of professional metadata extracted from Amazon Books enriched with user-generated contents from LT. Professional metadata contains title, isbn,
publisher, sometimes table of contents while user-generated
contents contains similar-products (together-bought books),
tags (labels tagged by users), reviews, ratings, browse-Nodes
(a hierarchy of nodes to organize for sale). In addition, some
statistics generated by users indirectly are also contained
like some popularity statistics counted by month, specifically
how many members added, reviewed, recommend the book
at each month.

where 𝑅𝐵 is the set of ratings of book 𝐵, 𝑚
ˆ is the unweighed
arithmetic mean value of ratings over all the books. And 𝑛
represents the number of ratings, while 𝑛
ˆ is the average of 𝑛.
We respectively collect the statistics of different user actions (like how many people added the book into catalog
𝑎𝑑𝑑, how many people reviewed 𝑟𝑒𝑣, how many people recommend 𝑟𝑒𝑐) monthly and directly utilize the normalization
score as feature vectors. As a result, (𝐵𝐴, 𝑎𝑑𝑑, 𝑟𝑒𝑣, 𝑟𝑒𝑐) can
be regarded as a monthly quality embedding and we can also
use the convolutional neural networks mentioned in Sec. 3.1.1
to generate the vector representation for Quality.

contents, so the dynamic k-max pooling proposed in [5] is
applied as the pooling function, where the value of 𝑘 depends
on the input size.
Through the sentence model, rich feature representations
of some text descriptions can be built to capture the overall
semantics of the input sentences.

3.3

3.1.2 Matching Topics and Books. As describe in Sec. 2,
topics are made up with title, group and narrative while books
consist of title, tags and reviews. We make a hypothesis that
the text descriptions appeared in a same field are indivisible.
Therefore, the title text, the group text and all sentences in
narrative text are respectively fed into the sentence model to
learn the vector representations. Similarly, when embedding
the book contents, the book title, the tags and the reviews are
separate input of the sentence model. It is worth mentioned
that for the tags, the number of users annotating the tag is
multiplied as a weight of convolution feature maps before the
pooling layer. Finally, the resulting vector representations of
topics and books x𝑡 and x𝑏 can be used for computing the
similarity score with Eq. (1),
𝑠𝑖𝑚(x𝑡 , x𝑏 ) = x𝑇
𝑡 𝑀 x𝑑

𝑠𝑖𝑚(𝐵𝑖 , 𝐵𝑗 ) = 𝑐𝑜𝑠⟨𝑣𝑒𝑐𝑖 , 𝑣𝑒𝑐𝑗 ⟩

Diversity Embedding

Diversity is another significant issue to be addressed when
building reading lists because no duplicated or overlapped
results are expected. The general goal of diversification is to
balance between the good performances of individual results
based on the above three factors and the overlapping among
the results. Therefore, we can compute the similarities with
the other candidate books to map the Diversity into vectors.

(1)

Quality is a factor which is critical for every recommendation
tasks. Even though a book might be highly relevant with
a topic, we cannot recommend the book if written poorly.
Compared to Relevance, this factor only concerns the books.
We categorize the statistics of books on social media into
two groups: ratings and popularities throughout the time.
We compute the Bayesian Average Ratings of each month
through Eq. (2),
∑︀

(3)

where 𝑣𝑒𝑐𝑖 stands for the vector representation for book 𝐵𝑖
and ⟨𝑣𝑒𝑐𝑖 , 𝑣𝑒𝑐𝑗 ⟩ is the angle between the two vectors. In this
way, the Timeliness can be represented by the similarities
between the book and top K popular books at the time when
the topic is posted.

where 𝑀 is a parameter optimized while training, which is
introduced detailedly in Sec. 3.5.

3.2

Timeliness Embedding

The reading interests changes from time to time, thus Timeliness is another factor to represent the differences among
popularity of books. Compared to Quality, this factor concerns more about the popularity trends, like what genres of
books are more popular at that time. Therefore, the simplest
way to embed the timeliness is to compare with the most
popular books. We can achieve the vector representations of
books from Sec. and the similarities between two books 𝐵𝑖
and 𝐵𝑗 can be easily computed through Eq. 3.

3.5

Training

The model is trained to minimize the cross-entropy function:
𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡 = −

∑︁

[𝑦𝑖 log 𝛼𝑖 + (1 − 𝑦𝑖 ) log(1 − 𝛼𝑖 )] + 𝜆||𝜃||22

𝑖=1

where 𝛼 is the output of the softmax layer and 𝜃 contains all
the parameters. The parameters are optimized with stochastic
gradient descent (SGD) using back-propagation algorithm to
compute the gradients.

Table 3: Comparisons with SBS participants.

EXPERIMENTS

We collect 8,197 topics from 198 diverse groups on LT forum,
which are roughly divided into Simple (very specific groups like “Writer’s Brag and Rag Bag”, 2459 topics), Normal
(groups concerning about some topic like “Weird Fiction”,
4810 topics) and Hard (very challenging group like “50 Book
Challenge”, 928 topics). The ground truth sets are constructed by the actual suggestions from other users.
We also evaluate the performances on the Social Book
Search (SBS) 2012-16 datasets. These benchmarks are also
collected from LT. However, the benchmarks merely focus
on the simple topics and the importance of the suggestions
are defined by the relevance values based on the assessments
of the topic creators and other members.

4.1

Comparisons with Components

In order to deeply understand the effectiveness of the four
embedded factors, we respectively present the performances
with all four factors represented as input features, namely
RQTD, and seven baselines which contain some parts, namely,
R, RD, RT, RQ, RTD, RQD and RQT in Table 2.
The results show that the method with fully input vectors
performs better than all the other baselines across all the
benchmarks. On most benchmarks, the Relevance are the
most important factor. However, for hard topics, the Quality
and Timeliness performs even better than the Relevance.
Moreover, through comparisons between with or without
embedding one factor, we can conclude that the four designed
factors are all beneficial for the overall performances.
