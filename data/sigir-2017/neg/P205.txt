ABSTRACT

1

Displaying banner advertisements (in short, ads) on webpages has
usually been discussed as an Internet economics topic where a
publisher uses auction models to sell an online user’s page view
to advertisers and the one with the highest bid can have her ad
displayed to the user. This is also called real-time bidding (RTB)
and the ad displaying process ensures that the publisher’s benefit
is maximized or there is an equilibrium in ad auctions. However,
the benefits of the other two stakeholders – the advertiser and the
user – have been rarely discussed. In this paper, we propose a
two-stage computational framework that selects a banner ad based
on the optimized trade-offs among all stakeholders. The first stage
is still auction based and the second stage re-ranks ads by considering the benefits of all stakeholders. Our metric variables are:
the publisher’s revenue, the advertiser’s utility, the ad memorability, the ad click-through rate (CTR), the contextual relevance, and
the visual saliency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
work that optimizes trade-offs among all stakeholders in RTB by
incorporating multimedia metrics. An algorithm is also proposed
to determine the optimal weights of the metric variables. We use
both ad auction datasets and multimedia datasets to validate the
proposed framework. Our experimental results show that the publisher can significantly improve the other stakeholders’ benefits by
slightly reducing her revenue in the short-term. In the long run,
advertisers and users will be more engaged, the increased demand
of advertising and the increased supply of page views can then
boost the publisher’s revenue.

Over the last few years, a significant development in display advertising is the emergence of RTB. It is a non-guaranteed delivery
system in which page views (also called impressions) are bought and
sold via programmatic instantaneous auctions [15]. The success of
RTB can be largely attributed to its user targeting and wide access.
In RTB, advertisers bid for an impression from their targeted user
and this impression can be from any webpage from any ad network
or platform. If an advertiser wins the auction, her ad will be selected
and be displayed to the user in almost real time.
RTB has two major limitations. The first limitation is that it can
not provide guaranteed delivery to advertisers. Therefore, those
who want to secure and access future impressions in advance will
not be satisfied [29]. The solution is to develop a new system that enables time-dependent allocation and pricing of future impressions.
Notable examples include the recently discussed programmatic
guarantee and ad options [8–11, 41]. The second limitation of RTB
is that those displayed ads may not fit their hosting webpages well
due to user targeting. It can be: the ad content is irrelevant to the
webpage content; the color of the ad image is too light or dark
to sufficiently contrast with the webpage color scheme. Ill-fitting
ads will affect the effectiveness of ad branding for the advertiser,
or even worse annoy users, and potentially reduce the publisher’s
webpage visits and revenue. It should be noted that this limitation
only exists in display advertising, since sponsored search ads are
displayed in terms of textual links where visual effects are not very
important and also these ads are keyword-based which are well
matched with the user’s search query. In display advertising, this
limitation is worth investigating. Firstly, it has received surprisingly
little attention in the recent studies. Secondly, it is an interesting
topic that lies in the area combining the research of marketing,
multimedia, recommendation, and Internet economics.
In this paper, we discuss a solution to the second limitation of
RTB by proposing a computational framework that optimizes tradeoffs among stakeholders. As shown in Fig. 1, the framework has
two stages. The first stage is based on the existing ad auction model
used in RTB; and the second stage re-ranks ads based on the optimal
trade-offs. In the re-ranking, there are six metric variables: the publisher’s revenue, the advertiser’s utility, the ad memorability, the
ad CTR, the contextual relevance and the visual saliency. Revenue
is always the key concern for the publisher. From an advertiser’s
perspective, her utility is the short-term benefit and the ad memorability is the long-term benefit. The rest three metric variables
represent the user’s benefits. Under the proposed framework, we
discuss an algorithm that determines the optimal weights of the
metric variables. In the paper, we validate the proposed framework
on several datasets, including ad auction datasets and multimedia
datasets. The ground truth and possible weights combinations for

INTRODUCTION

Session 2B: Filtering and Recommending 1

SIGIR’17, August 7-11, 2017, Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan

Leyton-Brown [39] studied a variety of ways of increasing revenue
of GSP auctions, including reserve prices and squashing parameter.
Furthermore, Yuan et al. [42] implemented a large scale experiment
and empirically compared algorithms of setting reserve price for
maximizing revenue in RTB.
Trade-offs among multiple objectives or stakeholders have been
discussed in several works. Likhodedov and Sandholm [23] proposed a framework that linearly combines revenue and social welfare in a single-item auction. Radlinski et al. [34] investigated the
optimization of relevance and revenue in sponsored search. Similarily, Liao et al. [22] combined revenue and relevance for video
advertising. Lucier et al. [24] discussed the revenue of GSP auction
at equilibrium, and demonstrated that revenue can be maximized
at a non-envy-free equilibrium that also generates a socially inefficient allocation. Roberts et al. [36] discussed a new ranking
algorithm for sponsored search auction that uses reserve prices to
order the ads and discussed conditions under which revenue can be
increased. Bachrach et al. [3] proposed a framework that linearly
combines objectives relevant to the search engine (revenue), the
advertiser (welfare), and the user (clicks).
Most related advertising research focuses on the economic benefits, little attention has been paid to the advertiser’s branding
effectiveness and user’s experience. Therefore, we introduce several multimedia metrics in this paper. Literature in marketing and
consumer psychology has already shown that the contextual relevance between the content of hosting webpage and the ads makes
a large difference in their clickability [7], and it also has a leading
effect on user’s online experience [25]. There exists rich research
on measuring the contextual relevance using textual information.
Neto et al. [35] investigated ten strategies for a vector space model
and evaluated their effectiveness individually. Although the vector
space model is widely used, a more advanced matching strategy is
required due to the vocabulary impedance problem among ads and
webpages. Broder et al. [5] proposed an approach for contextual
ad matching based on a combination of semantic and syntactic
features. Li et al. [21] further measured the contextual relevance
by introducing category relevance, keyword relevance, and style
relevance. Category relevance measures whether the ad and webpage belong to the same category; keyword relevance measures the
relevance between the keywords extracted from ads and webpage;
and style relevance measures the style consistency between the ads
and webpage. Zhang et al. [44] proposed an advertising keywords
recommendation system for short-text webpages with the help of
Wikipedia. Other than textual information, images and videos are
more popular on the Internet. Chen et al. [13] allocated ads for
images through image recognition techniques. To achieve better
contextual relevance, Mei et al. [26, 27] and Guo et al. [16] proposed
a multimodal approach which considered both textual and visual
relevance for video and image advertising.
Although display banner ads appear on nearly every webpage,
their effectiveness remains debatable. Through a series of eyetracking experiments, recent research found that users tend to
avoid ads in web search and surfing [4] and they intentionally avoid
looking at such ads even when they are designed to be attentiongrabbing [37]. This is also known as ad overlook. Moreover, Owen
et al. [31] explored the relationship between ads location and the
degree of blindness – the phenomenon of website users actively

re-ranking are discussed. Our experimental results show that a
slight decrease in the publisher’s revenue can increase the performance of other variables significantly in the short term, which will
also improve the engagements of both advertisers and users in the
long term, and further increase the publisher’s revenue.
This paper has two major contributions. Firstly, the user’s benefits have been taken into account. This is similar to the work of
Bachrach et al. [3]. Compared to their work, we increase the dimension of benefits by discussing trade-offs among stakeholders’
multiple benefits. The framework is also tailored to RTB rather
than sponsored search. Our proposed model can be regarded as
a generalized framework that non-guaranteedly deliveries banner
ads in RTB. Secondly, multimedia metrics have been introduced to
measure some stakeholders’ benefits, such as the ad memorability,
the contextual relevance, and the visual saliency. These metrics
naturally fit display banner ads but have not yet been discussed
along with auction models in previous studies. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work that combines multimedia metrics
and auction theory together.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews
the related literature. Section 3 discusses the proposed two-stage
framework. Section 4 presents our experimental results, and Section 5 concludes the paper.

RELATED WORK

In online advertising, the generalized second-price (GSP) auction [14,
40] and the Vickrey-Clark-Groves (VCG) auction [32] have been
widely used on different platforms, including display and search
domains. Revenue maximization is always the key issue. Lahaie and
Pennock [19] proposed to use a squashing parameter to increase
revenue of GSP auctions in sponsored search, and then Lahaie and
McAfee [18] showed that it can improve social welfare as well.
Ostrovsky and Schwarz [30] investigated the effects of optimal reserve prices for GSP auctions on Yahoo’s platform. Thompson and

Stage II: Optimal Re-Ranking

All advertisers are re-ranked in the second stage. The rank score of
advertiser i,i ∈ Nz , is defined as follows:
X
rsi,z =
ωk x k,i,z ,
(6)
k ∈K

where x k,i,z is the input value of metric variable k, ωk is its weight,
and k ∈ K = {1, · · · , 6}. Below we discuss what are these variables,
how to obtain their input values and their weights in the re-ranking.
3.2.1 Specifications of Metric Variables. Table 2 specifies our
metric variables in the re-ranking, including the publisher’s revenue, the advertiser’ utility, the ad memorability, the ad CTR, the
contextual relevance, and the ad saliency. The input values of these
metric variables in the second stage are denoted by x k,i,z ,∀k ∈ K,
respectively. They are the normalized values lying between 0 and 1
by using the min-max method for a set of auctions.
Revenue is always the key issue for the publisher. In rank score
rsi,z , it can be measured by advertiser i’s (normalized) payment,
whose value can be obtained from ad auction in Stage I.
For advertiser i, her benefit can be measured at short-term and
long-term levels. The short-term benefit is her utility, which is
defined as the difference between her value and payment. It shows
the advertiser’s cost saving. In the long run, the ad’s memorability
is an important metric, particularly, for branding purpose [28]. It
shows how likely the user will remember the advertiser’s ad a few
weeks or months later. Here we employ the MemNet model [17]
to predict visual memorability of ad image. It is a convolutional
neural network (CNN) trained in an annotated image memorability
dataset, where the input is an ad image and the output is a single
real value which indicates the memorability of this image. The
higher the value is, the more memorable is the image.
The user’s benefit can be measured by her page view experience, including the ad CTR, the contextual relevance and the ad
saliency [20]. The ad CTR is defined as the number of clicks on the
advertiser’s ad divided by the number of displays, whose value is

THE TWO-STAGE FRAMEWORK

The proposed framework consists of two stages. The first stage is
based on the second-price (SP) auction model. The second stage reranks ads based on the weighted linear combination of benefits of
multiple stakeholders, which ensures the selected ad will optimize
the trade-offs among them. For the reader’s convenience, the key
notations are summarized in Table 1.

ignore web banner ads – and found that users tend to ignore ads
located on the bottom and right area. Intuitively, any ad that fails
to capture an user’s attention will be ineffective in delivering information. It has been recognized that there are five basic stages
before a user accepts a message: attention, comprehension, yielding,
retention and action [1]. Motivated by the above observation, in
addition to the contextual relevance, we further introduce two other
factors to increase user engagement towards banner ads: the visual
saliency and the ad image memorability. The former increases the
probability that an user will notice the displayed ad while the latter
improves an user’s brand perception after she sees the ad image.

Stage I: Ad Auction

In RTB, the SP auction model has been widely used. Consider
auction z ∈ Z , a single impression is bidded by nz advertisers,
their cost-per-impression1 bids are denoted by a bid vector bz =
(b1,z , · · · ,bnz ,z ), and their true values are denoted by a value vector
vz = (v 1,z , · · · ,vnz ,z ). In the simplest scenario, the advertiser with
the highest bid will be selected and her ad will be displayed to
the user. When the ad is displayed, the advertiser then pays the
publisher for this page view. In order to re-rank ads in the second
stage, we need to know what would be the possible payments from
other advertisers. To achieve this, nz − 1 pseudo ad slots are created
so that the payments from other advertisers can be estimated.
1 In

display advertising industry, the cost-per-impression is usually quoted in terms of
cost-per-mille (CPM) which represents the price of 1000 impressions.

usually given by data or can be estimated from historical advertising
records. In essence, the ad CTR is an ad quality metric – a high CTR
means that the advertiser’s ad is attractive and also more relevant
to the user’s needs. The contextual relevance measures if the ad
content is more or less relevant to its hosting webpage content. If
an ad is more relevant, it will be less intrusiveness [27]. In the paper,
we use the TakeLab system [38] to measure the semantic similarity
of textual contents between the ad and the webpage. TakeLab uses
a support vector regression model with multiple features measuring
the word-overlap similarity and syntax similarity. The input is two
textual sentences and the output is the semantic similarity score.
The score ranges from 0 to 5, where 0 indicates irrelevant and 5
indicates totally relevant. We construct the textual information of
the webpage and the ad by using the webpage title, keywords and
description, etc. An advantage of TakeLab is that it has an outstanding performance in measuring the similarity between short text
snippets, while most other algorithms focus on large documents.
The ad saliency metric measures whether the ad image can be easily
spotted within its hosting webpage. The more salient ads tend to
draw more user’s attention [12]. In the paper, we use the minimum
barrier salient (MBS) object detection method [43] to calculate the
saliency of the ad image. The input is image screenshots of ad and
webpage, and the output is the corresponding saliency map. For
each pair of webpage and ad candidate, we embed the ad into the
webpage and use the MBS method to compute the saliency map
and the saliency score is the mean value of each pixel within the
ad area.

Discussion

Display advertising is an interplay among different stakeholders. A
vigorous and healthy advertising eco-system should consider the
benefits of all stakeholders. Compared with the existing advertising
systems that select ads mainly from the publisher’s interest, our
proposed framework select ads based on the optimized trade-offs
among stakeholders. The incorporated multimedia metrics are
computed by the state-of-the-art multimedia techniques, including
the MemNet model for the ad image memorability [17], the TakeLab
method for the semantic similarity [37], and the MBS method for
the visual saliency [43]. Moreover, our framework can be extended
with more metrics, such as ad interestingness and image aesthetic.
It should be also noted that the proposed two-stage framework
does not ensure advertisers to be truth-telling in Stage I. If an advertiser is truth-telling, her utility can be obtained by computing the
difference between her bid and payment. If she is not truth-telling,
her value can be learnt from historical ad auctions in Stage I. Value
estimation models were discussed by Athey and Nekipelov [2], and
Pin and Key [33], respectively. Similarly, we can assume each advertiser is optimal – who maximizes her expected utility in the
bidding – and then estimate her value from the training data, and
the data should be obtained from the two-stage framework rather
than the existing RTB campaigns. On the other hand, we think the
proposed framework will not significantly affect an advertiser’s
truthfulness. Firstly, the three multimedia metric variables and the
ad CTR are exogenous. They do not directly affect an advertiser’s
bidding behaviour. Secondly, advertisers’ payments are computed
by creating pseudo slots. If an advertiser is not the winning advertiser in the ground truth but she is selected after re-ranking, her

the ground truth.
The optimal weights maximize the sum of rank scores of the
select advertisers from all auctions in the training set. Eqs. (8)(9) ensure each variable has an impact in the re-ranking but its
impact has an upper bound. Eqs. (10)-(11) further specify the lower
bounds of trade-offs where the maximum decrease of the publisher’s
revenue and the minimum increases for other variables.

3.2.2 Determination of the Optimal Weights. The weights of
variables in the rank score determine the optimal trade-offs. As
described earlier, the publisher needs to sacrifice a certain amount
of revenue in the short term in order to increase the benefits of other
stakeholders. Let θ 1 be the maximum pre-determined loss rate of
revenue and let θ k ,∀k ∈ K\{1}, be the minimum increase rate of
other variables. Given the maximum loss and the minimum increase
targets, we can obtain the optimal weights from the training set ZH.

Figure 2: Unique ads in the multimedia datasets.

The two platforms use different ad networks: AOL uses AOL Advertising; YouTube uses Google AdSense. Both datasets were collected
in Singapore. As we focus on the single slot ad displaying, each
webpage in our datasets contains only one ad slot. We start collecting the data from a particular seed URL that contains multiple
categories of content.2 In this way, the diversity of webpages and
banner ads can be ensured. In collecting the data, the web browser
is set in the privacy mode, which disables browsing history, web
cache and data storage in cookies so that the collected banner ads
are not affected by the previous page views. In each dataset, we extract the ads from their webpages to create a set of banner ads and a
set of webpages with blank ad slots. For each webpage, the collected
data includes title, keywords, description, whole webpage snapshot,
ad image. We also crawl title, keywords and description from the ad
landing page (i.e., the delivered webpage if an ad is clicked by the
visiting user). Note that we do not consider animation ads in our
banner ads. When collecting text information about the webpage
for YouTube, we also crawl video tags. All the collected text data
can be viewed as a summary about the webpage, which can be
used to measure the contextual relevance with ad candidates in
experiments. Table 3 describes our multimedia datasets. We collect
5,243 unique webpages from AOL and 7,173 unique webpages from
YouTube, and the number of their corresponding unique banner
ads are 96 and 539, respectively. Fig. 2 shows the growth trends of
unique ads on both platforms. Although there are a large number
of impressions in the ad network, only a few ads are displayed.
We find that some ads re-appear from time to time. The repetitive
display strategy reinforces users’ memory for branding but it also
is a source of intrusiveness into users’ online experience [6].
The two ad auction datasets contain campaign information for
display advertising and sponsored search. Table 4 provides a brief
summary of both datasets. For display advertising, the dataset reports 33,043,127 bids in 6,646,643 auctions over 31 ad slots from a
medium-size supply-side platform (SSP) in the UK over the period
from 08 January 2013 to 14 February 2013. This SSP dataset has also
been used in several recent online advertising studies [8, 11, 42]
and is used as the major dataset in our experiments. In the other ad

on different ad positions; the AOL and YouTube datasets contain
screenshots of ads and webpages and their textual descriptions,
which can be used to calculate the multimedia metrics such as
ad image memorability, the contextual relevance, and the visual
saliency. To simulate a real world display advertising environment,
we randomly sample and match records and metrics to connect our
auction datasets with the multimedia datasets so that each ad will
have both bidding campaign records and multimedia metrics. Given
a webpage from the multimedia datasets, we use the following five
steps to reproduce its corresponding auction:
Step 1: Sampling an auction in RTB
We randomly sample an auction from the SSP dataset. The auction contains a set of advertisers and their bids.
Step 2: Creating the ground truth data
Since the given webpage has an ad displayed when it is web
crawled. This original ad is considered as the ground truth.
Step 3: Sampling candidate ads
Let n denote the number of advertisers in the sampled auction
in Step 1. We then randomly sample n − 1 ads from the same

auction dataset, the estimated campaign results of 547 keywords
were crawled from Microsoft adCentre (now Bing Ads) over the
period from 26 Dec 2011 to 03 Mar 2012. In adCentre, the targeted
keywords, budget, and other settings like matching types were submitted to the system. It then returned a list of estimated statistics,
including the estimated cost-per-click (CPC), clicks, and impressions based on 8 positions, which are ranked from top to bottom in
the mainline paid listing and sidebar paid listing of search engine
result pages. The Microsoft dataset provides information of CTRs,
which is important in our proposed model but is not included in the
SSP dataset. Table 5 summarizes CTRs across keywords in the Microsoft dataset. Since we focus on the single slot ad displaying, we
use the CTR estimated from the first ad position from the mainline
paid listing to simulate the CTR in our experiments.

4.2

Experimental Settings

As described in Section 4.1, each of our datasets only provides
partial information: the SSP dataset provides advertisers’ bids for
each auction which can also be used for computing the revenue
and the utility; the Microsoft dataset provides CTR distributions

multimedia dataset of the webpage. To ensure the uniqueness
of each ad in the auction, we exclude the original ad when we
sample n − 1 ads from the multimedia dataset.
Step 4: Matching ads and bids
We match the n bids with n ads. Since the original ad is displayed,
we consider it belongs to the winning advertiser in the auction
and match it with the highest bid. The rest n − 1 ads and n − 1
bids are then randomly matched.
Step 5: Simulating CTRs
For each ad, we generate its CTR from a uniform distribution
in the range of 0 and 13.97‰+ 1.96 × 28.49‰. This is based on
the mean and std. of CTRs in the first position in the Microsoft
dataset, as also shown in Table 5.

The above five steps allow us to have enough information to
compute the mentioned six metric variables for each ad in each
auction. We then re-rank ads based on the trade-offs preference,
which is expressed in terms of weights. In experiments, we perform
the 10-fold cross validation method to obtain the optimal weights
as well as to provide the performance analysis.

Variable Analysis

The values of metric variables in the ground truth are examined –
those ads which have been recommended to users under the SP auction model in RTB. For each impression, it contains the publisher’s
revenue, the advertiser’s utility, the ad CTR, and the multimedia
variables. Fig. 3 shows the descriptive statistics. The density plots

211

Session 2B: Filtering and Recommending 1

along the diagonal show the distribution of each variable individually; the scatter plots lying in the lower triangular region show how
much one variable is affected by another; and their linear correlations are given in the corresponding areas in the upper triangular
part. The scatter plots lying on the bottom row shows the values of
each variable under the two platforms and the right column show
the variations and outliers of each variable. Note that relevance
score ranges from 0 to 5, where 5 indicates most relevant and 0 indicates irrelevant, and the scores of memorability and saliency range
from 0 to 1, respectively. Several findings are worth mentioning.
Firstly, many displayed ads in the ground truth data are irrelevant
to the contents of their hosting webpages, which will result in less
user engagement. Secondly, most of displayed ads are not salient,
thus can be easily overlooked. These two findings may explain the
phenomenon of ad overlook in the existing advertising systems [37].
We also find that pairwise variables are independent, which allows
using linear combination to calculate the rank score for each ad in
the auction without considering the correlation matrix.

Fig. 4 presents an empirical example of analysing trade-offs among
stakeholders by investigating all advertisers’ ads and possible weights
of metric variables. Fig. 4(a) shows the screenshot of the webpage,
where ad 3010 (i.e., the ground truth) is displayed on the side bar.
Since the sampled RTB auction has 9 advertisers, we further sample 8 candidate ads from the AOL dataset. They have almost the
same width and length as the ground truth ad. However, they have
different contents, color themes, and descriptions. Fig. 4(a) table
exhibits the computed values of variables for re-ranking, where the
ground truth has been highlighted in bold. It has the highest value
in revenue; and relatively high values in utility, memorability; but
small values in CTR, relevance and saliency. Obviously, the ground
truth is biased towards the publisher’s interest.
Radar charts shown in Fig. 4(b) provide a clearer comparison of
the ground truth ad with other ad candidates. Each radar chart has
multiple axes and each variable is shown as a point on the axis. A
point closer to the center on an axis indicates a lower value and vice
versa. In radar charts, all values of variables are further normalized
into the range between 0 and 1. If all the variables’ values of an ad
are less than another ad, we call it being strictly dominated because
this ad will have no possibility to be selected in the second stage
re-ranking. For example, ad 1319 is strictly dominated and its area
in the radar chart can be fully covered by ad 3402.
Fig. 4(c) shows all possible combinations of the weights in the
re-ranking. For each subplot, x-axis represents all the weights instances that make the ad win the auction, and y-axis represents the
values of weights in each instance based on stack bars. Note that the
subplots of ad 1319 and ad 1847 are empty, indicating that no matter
what weights we choose, these two ads will never be selected in
the auction. An ad can be selected if its high valued variables have
large weights. Of course, the weights represent the preference of
trade-offs and different numbers of weights combination instances
of ads also tell that they do not have equal chances to be selected
in the re-ranking. Although ad 1847 is not strictly dominated in
radar charts, it is not been selected in all weights combinations.
This is because most of its variables’ values are relatively small and

its highest variable value is still less than that of ad 3010. Therefore, even when the trade-offs preference is biased towards the ad
memorability, the rank score of ad 1847 is still less than ad 3010.
We simply call it to be weakly dominated.

4.5

Overall Results

We validate the proposed framework by conducting the 10-fold
cross validation on both AOL and YouTube datasets. The optimal
weights are estimated from the training set; they are then used
for re-ranking ads in the auctions in the test set. For simplicity
but without lose of generality, the threshold value θ k is set to be
zero for any k ∈ K \ {1} so that the effects of θ 1 can be examined
explicitly. As described earlier, θ 1 is the maximum decrease of
the publisher’s revenue, which indicates how much the publisher
would like to sacrifice in order to increase the benefits of the other
two stakeholders. Therefore, θ 1 lies in the interval between -1 and 0.

The smaller the value of θ 1 , the more is the increase in the benefits
of other stakeholders.
Fig. 5 presents the effect of θ 1 on the sum of rank scores of the
selected advertisers in auctions. When θ 1 decreases, the sum of
rank scores increases. This monotone decreasing pattern is because
that the solution space of weights increases if θ 1 decreases (see
Section 3.2.2). Also, in the 10-fold cross validation, the size of the
training set is 9 times of the test set, the solution space of weights
and the sum of rank scores in the training set are roughly 9 times
of the test set. The effects of θ 1 on the changes of metric variables
are examined in Fig. 6. In both AOL and YouTube datasets, the
changes of variables in the training data follow the same patterns
as those in the test data. If θ 1 is close to 0, the SP auction (the
ground truth) is the optimal solution. This means that our model
suggests that the publisher shouldn’t sacrifice any revenue. If the
publisher further decreases θ 1 , the optimal weights change. There
will be some growth in the variables of other stakeholders, and of
course, the publisher’s revenue starts to decrease. If θ 1 is small, the
publisher’s revenue will decrease significantly and she may find it
unacceptable. As shown in Fig. 6, if θ 1 is less than -0.3, it reduces the
publisher’s revenue by almost 30%. There is no monotone increasing
pattern in other variables. Analyzing the changes in variables will
help the publisher to decide a proper θ 1 . Tables 6-7 further present

two special cases: θ 1 = −0.06 for the AOL dataset; and θ 1 = −0.07
for the YouTube dataset. Both cases show the results when the
decrease in the publisher’s revenue is close to the pre-specified
threshold value θ 1 . For example, there is about 5.5% decrease in
the publisher’s revenue in the AOL training set and other variables
enjoy certain increases ranging from 2.2% to 27.1%.

CONCLUSION

This paper discusses a two-stage framework that optimizes tradeoffs among stakeholders in display advertising. Different to many
related studies which only focus on the publisher’s revenue, we
further consider the benefits of the advertiser and the user by incorporating multimedia metrics. The trade-offs optimization is based
on a linear combination of all metric variables and their weights are
learnt from data. Variable and sensitivity analysis are conducted
to explore the solution space. Our experimental results validate
the proposed framework and show that it is able to increase the
benefits of other two stakeholders with just a slight decrease in
the publisher’s revenue. In the long run, better engagement of
advertisers and users will increase the demand of advertising and
supply of webpage visits, which can then boost the publisher’s revenue. Future research can potentially discuss a framework which
considers a generalised scenario where a webpage has multiple ad

slots being separately auctioned off in RTB. The long-term effects
of trade-offs optimization can also be further investigated and it
would be very interesting if the framework can be tested over a
live setting.
