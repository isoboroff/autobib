queries, and text documents, but also images, videos, live-streams,
locations, etc. are classified and linked to detect common interest groups, and select and rank good creators and good delivery
types in each group. With DL, Naver seeks to provide search results
that meet user needs more precisely while learning and improving
on the fly. In this talk, I’ll cover some efforts and challenges in
understanding and satisfying users on various devices.

ABSTRACT
Naver has been the most popular search engine for over a decade in
South Korea. As a search portal, Naver aims to match a user’s search
intentions to the information from the web pages and databases,
and to connect users based on shared interests to provide the best
way to find the information. Over the past decade, Naver has been
trying to better understand Korean users, queries, and web pages
for PC and mobile search. In 2002, Naver introduced Knowledge-IN,
which was the forerunner of community Question Answering to find
out the need of users and topic experts. Users can ask their specific
inquiry to appropriate topic experts in their search results.

In addition to PC and mobile, Naver is trying to enable a user to
access the relevant information using any other device or interface.
In detecting common interest groups and good creators, Naver adds
device and interface factors. Not only the contents, but also the
delivery media types are important in satisfying users on various devices. Deep learning (DL) based methods have tremendous progress
in image and text classification. With DL based methods, not only
