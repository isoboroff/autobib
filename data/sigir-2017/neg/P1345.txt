ABSTRACT

BIO

Twenty years ago, I fell into the trap of believing that good
performance on TREC Ad Hoc could be turned into commercial success via an enterprise search (ES) start-up. Although
we achieved a measure of success, the reality was very different from my expectations. It turned out that end-users
cared about search relevance only to the extent of reaching
for buckets of vitriol when search failed to find what they
wanted, and people making purchasing decisions were more
interested in other things: what repositories can be included
in the search, how responsive search is to updates, what
security models are provided, the appearance of the search
pages, and achieving internal business goals – even at the expense of end-user needs. Organizations often purchase search
technology as part of another system, such as a content management system, or a records management system, leaving
other repositories unsearchable or incompatibly searchable.
Causes of enterprise search failure include dimensions studied
in IR but an ES system often fails because of the way it is
configured, or because it fails to cover information resources
that end-users need. The dream of a comprehensive, highly
relevant, fully secure single search interface to all of an organization’s information is very rarely achieved. There is a
huge market potential for a killer ES product but the biggest
challenges in exploiting it lie outside the scope of IR research.
I look forward to sharing lessons learned from attempting
to commercialize IR technology, and new perspectives from
my current employment at Bing.

David Hawking is a Partner Architect in the Relevance Sciences team, based
in Canberra and working
on the Bing search engine.
Prior to joining Microsoft
in 2013, David was Chief
Scientist at the internet
and enterprise search company Funnelback, a CSIRO
spinoff. He was a CSIRO researcher between 1998 and
2008.
David is an honorary professor at the Australian National
University and has graduated ten PhD students. He has authored around a hundred publications in the Information
Retrieval area (see david-hawking.net) and twice served as
program chair for the ACM SIGIR conference. He chaired
SIRIP 2014 and was Web Track coordinator at the NISTorganized international Text Retrieval Conference (TREC)
from 1997-2004. In this role he was responsible for the creation and distribution of widely used text retrieval benchmark
collections. He holds an honorary doctorate from the University of Neuchtel (Switzerland), the 2005 Chris Wallace
award (Australasia) for computer science research and the
2012 Tony Kent Strix award.
