ABSTRACT

1 INTRODUCTION

Fine-grained Sketch-based Image Retrieval (Fine-grained SBIR),
which uses hand-drawn sketches to search the target object
images, has been an emerging topic over the last few years. The
difficulties of this task not only come from the ambiguous and
abstract characteristics of sketches with less useful information,
but also the cross-modal gap at both visual and semantic level.
However, images on the web are always exhibited with
multimodal contents. In this paper, we consider Fine-grained SBIR
as a cross-modal retrieval problem and propose a deep multimodal
embedding model that exploits all the beneficial multimodal
information sources in sketches and images. In our experiment
with large quantity of public data, we show that the proposed
method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for Fine-grained
SBIR.

To capture the important property of objects at the fine-grained
level, such as pose, viewpoint and shape, Fine-grained
Sketch-based Image Retrieval (Fine-grained SBIR) is proposed
recently. It focuses on finding the correspondences between
sketches and images at the instance level, since the insistent
demand of better in-depth understanding for sketches. The
difficulty of Fine-grained SBIR is the inherently visual and
semantic gap between different modalities of sketches and images.
An image is generally exhibited in a form with different modalities
(i.e., visual and semantic), such as a web image with textual
description. However, sketches are less informative, and their
inherent abstractness and ambiguities cannot be well handled only
by exploiting the visual information [1, 2].
The first work for Fine-grained SBIR was proposed by [3],
which first learned the mid-level sketch representation, and then
used the graph matching to discover the pose correspondence
between sketches and images. However, these hand-crafted
features cannot bridge the cross-domain gap in deep level. [4]
formulated a cross-domain framework to learn the cross-domain
feature space to conduct Fine-grained SBIR using fine-grained
visual attributes and instance-level pair-wise annotations. [5]
introduced a specific database of shoes and chairs and developed a
deep triplet-ranking model for the instance-level SBIR. However,
such methods are either based on visual contents without
considering semantic attributes, or limited to small-scale datasets.
Recently, [6] proposed a large-scale database, “sketchy database”,
as a benchmark dataset for Fine-grained SBIR and tested several
popular cross-domain convolutional network architectures. In the
real SBIR environment, the multimodal information of annotated
images is usually ignored. Thus much closer attention has been
given to the methods that rely on exploiting multimodal attributes.
To capture both the visual and semantic similarities between
sketches and images at the fine-grained level, we introduce a deep
multimodal embedding model for Fine-grained SBIR. Our model is

an end-to-end learning framework to optimize the retrieval
performance by mining all the possible beneficial multimodal
information in sketches and annotated images. The model first
map three modalities of sketches, images and textual descriptions
into a shared common space through deep neural network and
then the correspondence correlations between query sketches and
their images/descriptions are maximized in that space through a
special combination of multimodal ranking loss and classification
loss. This is a novel and meaningful way that incorporates the
sketch-image visual comparisons and the sketch-description
semantic comparisons to enhance the performance of Fine-grained
SBIR. Our experiments on a large-scale benchmark dataset
demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model over the other
existing competitive methods for Fine-grained SBIR.

where 𝑃𝑖 ∈ 𝑅𝑑 and 𝑆𝑖 ∈ 𝑅𝑑 are the learnt intermediate vectors
for the given image and sketch; and 𝜃𝐼 and 𝜃𝑆 are the
parameters for the image CNNI and sketch CNNS. Following the
prior work of [6], we take GoogLeNet [8] as the embedding neural
network for visual sketches/images, and the 1,024-way average
pooling layer output after the last inception module is taken as the
embedded intermediate feature vectors for both images and
sketches.
To obtain better discriminative feature vectors that can
preserve fine-grained details, we use the annotated quintuple
{(𝑠𝑖 , 𝑝𝑖+ , 𝑡𝑖+ , 𝑝𝑖− , 𝑡𝑖− )}𝐾
𝑖 as the supervised information to train
the neural networks. Each quintuple consists of a query sketch
𝑠 and two images 𝑝+ and 𝑝− with their descriptions 𝑡 + and 𝑡 − ,
which are named as the positive and negative sample. For
Fine-grained SBIR, the positive samples are selected from the
target image set that shares both the fine-gained visual similarity
and semantic similarity to the query sketch, while the negative
ones are selected from the residual irrelevant sets. Thus there are
two branches of CNNs for images. Since the positive and negative
images are in the same modality, their CNNs share the same
architecture and parameters.

2.2 Recurrent Neural Network for Semantic Embedding

RNN has been widely used in natural language processing due to
its effectiveness in learning significant patterns of sequential data.
Thus we use RNN to model the textual descriptions for annotated
images. Given the textual descriptions [𝑡1 , 𝑡2 , 𝑡3 , … , 𝑡𝑁 ] of the
images [ 𝑝1 , 𝑝2 , 𝑝3 , … , 𝑝𝑁 ] , the goal is to learn the semantic
embedding function which can be defined as:
[𝑇1 , 𝑇2 , 𝑇3 , … , 𝑇𝑁 ] = 𝑅𝑁𝑁𝑇 ([𝑡1 , 𝑡2 , 𝑡3 , … , 𝑡𝑁 ]|𝜃𝑇 ) (2)
where 𝑇𝑖 ∈ 𝑅𝑑 is the learnt intermediate vectors for the i-th
image textual description in the embedding space; and 𝜃𝑇
denotes the parameters of the semantic embedding function
RNNT(·). Thus we first extract the deep semantic representation for
each image textual description from the RNN-based sentence
embedding model Skip-thought [9], which is pre-trained on a large
novel corpus from the BookCorpus dataset [10]. The Skip-thought
model aims at learning deep sentence vector representations,
which are good at mapping similar sentences that share semantics
and syntactics to similar vector representations. Its advantage is
that the training is unsupervised by using the continuity of
surrounding sentences, and the vocabulary of words can be easily
extended online. This model follows the encoder-decoder
framework, in which the encoder learns the feature vectors of
sentences and the decoder learns to generate the surrounding
t
sentences. Given the triplet adjacent sentences (Si-1, Si, Si+1), let X
be the word2vector representation of the t-th word in the sentence
Si and M be the numbers of words in the sentence. For encoder, a
t
GRU is used and a hidden state h i is produced at each time step,
which can be formulated as:
𝑧 𝑡 = 𝜎(𝑊𝑧 ∙ [ℎ𝑡−1 , 𝑋 𝑡 ])
𝑟 𝑡 = 𝜎(𝑊𝑟 ∙ [ℎ𝑡−1 , 𝑋 𝑡 ])
ℎ̃𝑡 = tanh(𝑊 ∙ [𝑟 𝑡 ∙ ℎ𝑡−1 , 𝑋 𝑡 ])
(3)
ℎ𝑡 = (1 − 𝑧 𝑡 ) ∗ ℎ𝑡−1 + 𝑧 𝑡 ∗ ℎ̃𝑡
where 𝑧 𝑡 is the update gate vector; 𝑟 𝑡 is the reset gate vector;
M
and ℎ̃𝑡 is the state update vector at the time step t. Thus h i can

2 DEEP MULTIMODAL EMBEDDING MODEL
Our architecture is a combination of Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). The
CNN maps sketches and images to their feature vectors and the
RNN maps the textual descriptions to the feature vectors in a
shared space. Then two objective functions are combined to
constraint the correlations of sketch-image pairs in that space.

2.1 Convolutional Neural Network for Visual
Embedding

We use the CNN for sketches and images to map them to their
intermediate vectors. Comparing to traditional visual descriptors
like HOG [7], such representations are closer to image semantics
due to the supervised learning. The CNN takes a raw fixed-sized
image as the input and produces a fixed-length vector after
stacked layers of operations, such as convolution, nonlinear
transformation and pooling. The feature map in the lower layer is
computed and then transmitted to the higher layer to acquire the
better representation. Since sketches and images belong to the
visual domain but different modalities, such two CNN
architectures for them are identical but they are trained without
sharing parameters. Specifically, given a set of images
[ 𝑝1 , 𝑝2 , 𝑝3 , … , 𝑝𝑁 ] and sketches [𝑠1 , 𝑠2 , 𝑠3 , … , 𝑠𝑁 ] and let
𝑝𝑖 ∈ 𝑅𝑚×𝑛 and 𝑠𝑖 ∈ 𝑅𝑚×𝑛 be an image and a sketch of size
𝑚 × 𝑛 , the embedding function for these two CNNs can be
formulated as:
[𝑃1 , 𝑃2 , 𝑃3 , … , 𝑃𝑁 ] = 𝐶𝑁𝑁𝐼 ([𝑝1 , 𝑝2 , 𝑝3 , … , 𝑝𝑁 ]|𝜃𝐼 )
[𝑆1 , 𝑆2 , 𝑆3 , … , 𝑆𝑁 ] = 𝐶𝑁𝑁𝑆 ([𝑠1 , 𝑠2 , 𝑠3 , … , 𝑠𝑁 ]|𝜃𝑆 )

be interpreted as the feature vector for the full sentence Si. For the
decoder, two GRUs are used, in which one is for generating the
previous sentence Si-1 and the other for generating the next
sentence Si+1. These two GRUs are trained separately without
sharing any parameters. Since they share the same computation
pattern, we only formulate the decoding process of the next
sentence Si+1 as follows.
𝑧 𝑡 = 𝜎(𝑊𝑧 ∙ [ℎ𝑡−1 , 𝑋 𝑡−1 , ℎ𝑖 ])
𝑟 𝑡 = 𝜎(𝑊𝑟 ∙ [ℎ𝑡−1 , 𝑋 𝑡−1 , ℎ𝑖 ])

ℎ𝑡 = tanh(𝑊 ∙ [𝑟 𝑡 ∙ ℎ𝑡−1 , 𝑋 𝑡−1 , ℎ𝑖 ])

= (1 − 𝑧 𝑡 ) ∗ ℎ𝑡−1 + 𝑧 𝑡 ∗ ℎ̃𝑡

where ℎ𝑖+1
is the hidden state of the decoder at the time step t,
and its computation is analogous to the encoder except that the
computation is conditioned on the feature vector ℎ𝑖 of the
sentence Si. The sum of log-probabilities for the previous and next
sentences is used as the objective function to guide the training for
the triplet adjacent sentences (Si-1, Si, Si+1).

where w i ,…, w i denotes the words in the sentence Si. Thus the
loss function of the Skip-thought model can be achieved by
summing up all the training triplets. We follow the combine-skip
pattern in [9], use the learnt encoder as the feature extractor, and
extract the 4,800-way vector as the deep semantic feature for each
description. Such deep semantic representations are then taken
into three layers of fully connected neural network to learn the
semantic embedding function in an end-to-end manner. The
intermediate vectors from the second layer are taken as the
embedding vectors in the shared space. Similar to the visual
embedding, two subnets for positive and negative samples (𝑡 + and
𝑡 − ) in the annotated quintuple share the same architecture and
parameters.

Thus the overall objective function of our deep multimodal
embedding model is a combination of classification loss and
multimodal ranking loss, which is formulated as follows:
𝑚𝑖𝑛: 𝑐𝐿𝑅𝐴𝑁𝐾 + (1 − 𝑐)𝐿𝐶𝐴𝑇𝐸𝐺𝑂𝑅𝑌 + 𝜆||𝜃||22
(9)
where 𝜃 denotes the parameters of embedding neural networks;
the last addend is a regularization term; and the parameter c is a
constant to control the impact of two loss functions. After
adequate training, the deep multimodal embedding model can
capture both the object category-level semantics and fine-grained
details, such as pose, viewpoint and shape. We take the
intermediate feature vectors in the embedding space as the feature
representation for sketches, images and textual descriptions. In the
testing time, given the embedded intermediate features of a query
sketch 𝑆𝑖 and a database image 𝑃𝑖 with the textual description
𝑇𝑖 , we compute the distance value between them as:
𝐷(𝑆𝑖 , 𝑃𝑖 , 𝑇𝑖 ) = ||𝑆𝑖 − 𝑃𝑖 ||2 + ||𝑆𝑖 − 𝑇𝑖 ||2
(10)
Thus the distance between query sketches and each annotated
image in the whole database can be measured at both visual and
semantic level. The ranking list of relevant images is obtained by
sorting the distance values of sketch-image pairs.

3 EXPERIMENT AND ANALYSIS
To evaluate our approach, we use a public benchmark dataset, i.e.,
large-scale Sketchy database [6]. It has 12,500 photos and 75,471
sketches of 125 object categories. Each category contains 100
images and each photo has at least 5 well-drawn sketches along
with the textual descriptions. 1,250 photos and their sketches are
selected for testing and the rest for training. We use the same
evaluation metrics as [6], i.e., Recall@K, which can be regarded as
the percentage of sketches whose true-match photos are ranked in
the Top-K and quantified by the cumulative matching accuracy at
various ranks. The positive samples for each sketch is set as the
true-matched images and textual descriptions. The negative ones
are obtained from both intra-category and inter-category of
images. We keep the sampling ratio between the intra- and
inter-category at 5:1, and the margin m of multimodal ranking loss
is set to 00.
Our deep multimodal embedding model aims at fusing
beneficial multimodal information in sketches and annotated
images, and analyzing their underlying correspondence
correlations to further enhance Fine-grained SBIR. To investigate
the contribution of each component, we introduce two evaluation
patterns: 1) investigating the impact of semantic embedding for
Fine-grained SBIR: we introduce a baseline of GN Triplet, which is
similar to our approach but only uses visual comparisons; 2)
comparing the effect of each component of objective function: we
set the constant parameter c in the objective function to 0, 0.5 and
1. When c=0, only the classification loss is used. When c =1, we
only use the multimodal ranking loss. When c = 0.5, both the

2.3 Objective Function

In the learning process of deep multimodal embedding model, we
aim at learning the embedding functions that map the input
sketches, images and textual descriptions into a common space, in
which the images and textual descriptions that are relevant to
query sketches are closer than those irrelevant ones. Specifically,
given the intermediate feature vectors 𝜓 = {(𝑆𝑖 , 𝑃𝑖+ , 𝑇𝑖+ , 𝑃𝑖− ,
𝑇𝑖− )}𝐾
𝑖 in that space of annotated quintuples, the goal can be
formulated as:
𝐷𝐹(𝑆𝑖 , 𝑃𝑖+ , 𝑇𝑖+ ) < 𝐷𝐹(𝑆𝑖 , 𝑃𝑖− , 𝑇𝑖− )
𝐷𝐹(𝑆𝑖 , 𝑃𝑖+ , 𝑇𝑖+ ) = ||𝑆𝑖 − 𝑃𝑖+ ||2 + ||𝑆𝑖 − 𝑇𝑖+ ||2
(6)
𝐷𝐹(𝑆𝑖 , 𝑃𝑖− , 𝑇𝑖− ) = ||𝑆𝑖 − 𝑃𝑖− ||2 + ||𝑆𝑖 − 𝑇𝑖− ||2
To achieve this goal, we extend the classic ranking loss to
adjust itself to three modalities that have the stronger ability to
characterize cross-modal sketch-image correlations, named as
multimodal ranking loss, which is formulated as:
𝐿𝑅𝐴𝑁𝐾 = ∑𝑖𝜖𝝍 𝑚𝑎𝑥(0, 𝑚 + 𝐷𝐹(𝑆𝑖 , 𝑃𝑖+ , 𝑇𝑖+ ) − 𝐷𝐹(𝑆𝑖 , 𝑃𝑖− , 𝑇𝑖− )) (7)
where m is the margin to control the relative distance between the
positive and negative pairs. The optimization for the objective
function will adjust the parameters to obtain the desired feature
embedding function that satisfies the ranking order. We also
utilize the classification loss to capture the category-level
semantics of sketches and images in that embedding space. The
classical “Softmax” loss function is used for each input modality

used along with sketches to more precisely retrieve target object
images from all the different modalities.
Table 1: The experimental results in different patterns.

classification loss and multimodal ranking loss are utilized. The
related experimental results are shown in Table 1.
It can be found from Table 1 that the best performance for
Fine-grained SBIR can be obtained in the evaluation pattern of our
full deep multimodal embedding model Ours (c=0.5). This confirms
the obvious advantage of our whole framework for Fine-grained
SBIR. Comparing Ours (c=0/0.5/1) with GN Triplet (c=0/0.5/1), the
improved Rank@K value proves the positive impact of introducing
the semantic comparisons between sketches and textual
descriptions of images. It can be concluded that the Fine-grained
SBIR performance can be further enhanced through mining all the
possible beneficial multimodal information sources in annotated
images, rather than only considering the unimodal visual
information in images. Furthermore, comparing the different
settings for the particular parameter c, the best performance can
be achieved when c is set to 0.5 while the modest performance is
obtained when c is set to 0. The main reason is that the
classification loss can only capture the category-level semantics
and cannot preserve the fine-grained details for Fine-grained SBIR.
The multimodal ranking loss can do it better because it’s based on
the relative similarities of the input quintuple, which is usually
judged by the fine-grained information. However, by combining
such two kinds of loss function, we can learn better embedding
function that capture both the category-level semantics and the
fine-grained details to further improve Fine-grained SBIR.
To give full exhibition to the superiority of our model, we have
performed a comparison between our model and several
state-of-the-art approaches. These methods include: (1) deep
ranking networks: GN Triplet (GN Triplet (c=0.5)), GN Siamese, GN
Triplet w/o Cat (GN Triplet (c=1)), and AN Siamese; (2)
recognition-based networks: GN Cat (GN Triplet (c=0)), SN w/Label
and SN; (3) traditional hand-crafted feature: GALIF [11]; and (4)
Simple baselines by chance: Chance and Chance w/Label. More
detailed implementation information of these methods can be
found in [6]. The recall value of different ranking positions,
Rank@K (K=1, 2, 3, …, 10), are presented in Figure 2. Similar
conclusion can be drawn as above. It’s worth noting that some of
these methods can achieve the high recall over 90% within the
top-10 retrieval results, such as GN Triplet, GN Triplet w/o Cat, and
GN Siamese. However, after introducing the semantic comparisons
between sketches and textual descriptions of images, the recall
value can be further improved, especially at the high ranking
position, i.e., Top-1. Meanwhile, the deep-learning-based
approaches significantly outperform the basic methods with
hand-crafted features like GALIF, which mainly attributes to the
effort of supervised training.

In this work, we present a deep multimodal embedding model to
support more precise Fine-grained SBIR for large-scale annotated
images. Our model can encode multimodal information into a
common space through deep neural networks, and exploit the
fine-grained cross-modal correspondences among the attributes of
different modalities in sketches and annotated images in that
space. An interesting future direction is to extend our method to
multimodal retrieval, where more semantic information will be
