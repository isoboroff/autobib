latencies, and (iv) propose a time-bounded solution for Documentat-a-Time (DaaT) query processing which is suitable for current
web search systems.
As a preliminary study, Crane et al. [3] compared some state-ofthe-art query processing strategies across many modern collections.
They found that although modern DaaT dynamic pruning strategies are very efficient for ranked disjunctive processing, they have
a much larger variance in processing times than Score-at-a-Time
(SaaT) strategies which have a similar efficiency profile regardless
of query length or the size of the required result set. Furthermore, Mackenzie et al. [8] explored the efficiency trade-offs for
paragraph retrieval in a multi-stage question answering system.
They found that DaaT dynamic pruning strategies could efficiently
retrieve the top-1,000 candidate paragraphs for very long queries.
Extending on prior work [3, 4, 7], Mackenzie et al. [9] showed
how a range of per-query efficiency settings can be accurately
predicted such that 99.99 percent of queries are serviced in less
than 200 ms without noticeable effectiveness loss. In addition, a
reference list framework [2, 4, 10] was used for training models
such that no relevance judgements or annotations were required.
Future work will focus on improving the candidate generation
stage in large-scale multi-stage retrieval systems. This will include
further exploration of index layouts, traversal strategies [3], and
query rewriting, with the aim of improving early stage efficiency
to reduce the system tail latency, while potentially improving endto-end effectiveness.

ABSTRACT
With the growing popularity of the world-wide-web and the increasing accessibility of smart devices, data is being generated at
a faster rate than ever before. This presents scalability challenges
to web-scale search systems – how can we efficiently index, store
and retrieve such a vast amount of data? A large amount of prior
research has attempted to address many facets of this question,
with the invention of a range of efficient index storage and retrieval frameworks that are able to efficiently answer most queries.
However, the current literature generally focuses on improving the
mean or median query processing time in a given system. In the
proposed PhD project, we focus on improving the efficiency of high
percentile tail latencies in large scale IR systems while minimising
end-to-end effectiveness loss.
Although there is a wealth of prior research involving improving
the efficiency of large scale IR systems, the most relevant prior work
involves predicting long-running queries and processing them in
various ways to avoid large query processing times. Prediction is
often done through pre-trained models based on both static and
dynamic features from queries and documents. Many different
approaches to reducing the processing time of long running queries
have been proposed, including parallelising queries that are predicted to run slowly [5, 6], scheduling queries based on their predicted run time [7], and selecting or modifying the query processing
algorithm depending on the load of the system [1, 11].
Considering the specific focus on tail latencies in large-scale IR
systems, the proposed research aims to: (i) study what causes large
tail latencies to occur in large-scale web search systems, (ii) propose a framework to mitigate tail latencies in multi-stage retrieval
systems through the prediction of a vast range of query-specific
efficiency parameters, (iii) experiment with mixed-mode query semantics to provide efficient and effective querying to reduce tail
