ABSTRACT
Result ranking in commercial web search engines is based on a
wide array of signals, from keywords appearing on web pages to behavioral (clickthrough) data aggregated across many users or from
the current user only. The recent emergence of wearable devices
has enabled the collection of physiological data such as heart rate,
skin temperature, and galvanic skin response at a population scale.
These data are useful for many public health tasks, but they may
also provide novel clues about people’s interests and intentions as
they engage in online activities. In this paper, we focus on heart
rate and show that there are strong relationships between heart
rate and various measures of user interest in a search result. We
integrate features of heart rate, including heart rate dynamics, as
additional attributes in a competitive machine-learned web search
ranking algorithm. We show that we can obtain significant relevance improvements from this physiological sensing that vary
depending on the search topic.

Figure 1: HR signal from a wearable device over the course
of a typical search engine interaction comprising query submission (Q0), result page examination, result clickthrough,
examination of a landing page, and a follow-on query (Q1).
The HR (red line) is observed to spike once the user views the
landing page. Features of the change in HR (e.g., the magnitude of the change in HR from SERP to landing page – denoted HR ∆ ) can be used as relevance signals. There is an observation period before and after the click at time tc during
which feature values can be calculated in offline settings.

BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION

Consumer fitness wearables such as FitBit and Apple Watch can
track signals such as sleep and physical activity from large populations of users. There has been significant research on the application of such wearable devices to persuade people to live healthier
lives [9] or recognize their physical activities [14]. Search logs
have been used for tasks ranging from understanding search behaviors [17] to improving ranking [3, 11]. Dwell time estimates
on landing pages provide insight into people’s engagement [7]
although time alone is insufficient to determine relevance [12].
Recent work has characterized relevance using neurological and
physiological methods [5, 8, 15, 16]. Unlike neurological measures,
physiological signals can be collected fairly easily. These have
been used for applications such as search personalization [1] and
satisfaction modeling [6]. One sensor that is common to many
wearable devices is a heart rate (HR) monitor, often implemented as
an optical sensor. Wearable devices record the HR in different ways,
depending on the nature of the sensor and their battery utilization
strategies. By joining HR signals with search engine activity data,

new opportunities emerge to understand relevance and improve
search engine effectiveness. We conjectured that by using HR data
from many users of wearable devices, and tracking how their HR
changes as they search the web, we can better estimate the relevance
of specific pages. Figure 1 shows a fictitious, but realistic, example
of these temporal dynamics. Initially the HR of the user is steady,
but there is a step change in the HR once they visit the search result
(landing page). Characteristics of HR dynamics (e.g., the delta in the
HR between the search engine result page (SERP) and the landing
page) may offer insight on landing-page relevance for the current
searcher, and future searchers when aggregated across queries and
integrated into a generic ranking algorithm.
Our research extends previous work on the use of physiological feedback, which has traditionally been used for personalization [8, 13, 15, 16], limiting its applicability to instrumented users
only. In this paper, we show that we can leverage physiological
signals at scale to improve the performance of search engine ranking algorithms. We show that we can learn ranking models from a
subset of the population for whom we collect physiological signals
that can significantly improve search relevance for all search engine
users, even the large subset of searchers who do not use wearables.

tracking is available (i.e., approximately 10% of the queries).
HR is tracked on the Band using an optical sensor sampling R
wave-to-R wave (RR) intervals at a rate of 60Hz. The resultant
HR estimate is logged once per second in beats per minute. The
HR estimate is accompanied by a quality reading from the device
between 0 and 10 (higher is better). We only use readings with a
rating of five or greater in our analysis. Logs were uploaded to a
remote server when users synced their Band with their smartphone.

Combining Data Streams

The two datasets described in the previous section were joined
together based on a common user identifier and timestamp, allowing the HR data to be associated directly with search events given
searcher consent. Being able to associate search events with physiological signals is critical for feature generation and the envisaged
application of these data in search result ranking. Since the focus
was on being able to infer relevance of landing pages for a given
query, we centered the analysis on those pages. We tracked HR in a
time window extending α seconds before and after the time of the
click (tc ). We experimented with α ∈ {30s, 120s, 300s}). We focus
on α = 300s since it allows us to maxmize query coverage. The
tracking period was terminated if the observation window expired
or there was another search action (query or click) before the end
of the observation period. Examples of both of these scenarios are
provided in Figure 1: early termination of tc − α at Q0 and completion of tc +α just prior to Q1. The HR readings during these periods
were recorded to compute descriptive statistics that could be used
as features in a machine-learned search-result ranking model.
Basic dataset statistics are shown in Table 1 for α = 300s, including the number of clicks for which we have HR data at different
points in time with respect to the click. One reason that there
were fewer clicks with HR pre-click than post-click is that the time
until the previous event was significantly lower pre-click (median
SERP dwell time=30s) than the time until the next event post-click
(median landing page dwell time=160s).

• Present the first study on using large-scale physiological signals
to train generic ranking algorithms that yield relevance gains;
• Demonstrate the clear relationship between HR signals and more
traditional indicators of searcher interests or relevance, namely
human relevance judgments, result clickthrough rate, and dwell
time on landing pages, and;
• Understand the impact of query topic on the utility of physiological signals for improving search relevance.

2 METHODS
2.1 Data
We use the data from the Microsoft Band and the Bing search
engine. Data were collected from a sample of 23k users of the
Band device who consented to connect their search and wearable
accounts through a common user identifier. This consent was collected to generate richer insights about people’s sleep and activity
by capitalizing on additional data from the search engine. To reduce the impact of cultural and linguistic factors, participants were
drawn from the United States geographic locale. Seven months of
query-click logs from Bing combined with Band data (both from
December 2015 to June 2016 inclusive) for these users were used to
generate features of search activity and physiology. For a subset of
the users in our dataset for whom we had least 1000 HR readings
in the three months from September to November 2015 inclusive
we could establish a normative HR, enabling the generation of
additional features related to deviations from their normal HRs.
The Bing search logs contained millions of search engine interactions comprising anonymized user identifiers, user actions (queries
and search-result clicks), and timestamps for those actions. The
Band records HR data in addition to other physiology, sleep, and
physical activity signals. To conserve battery life, the Band records
continuous HR data once per second for a sampling duration of
one minute out of every 10 minutes, unless the user is engaged
in workout activity (where logging is continual), and two minutes
out of every 10 minutes when asleep. That means that to obtain a

Featurization

To use the HR signals in ranking, we had to first create features
for each instance of a query-click pair in our log data and then
aggregate those features across all instances of the query-click pair
in our data. To improve the reliability of the aggregation, we hash
the URL to normalize case, remove trailing slashes, and collapse
HTTP and HTTPS protocols. We computed descriptive statistics
(average, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, range) on the
HR signals before and after the click separately, over the time period
extending from the click to the next/previous action or α, whatever
comes sooner. Changes in these feature values from before the click
to after the click (HR ∆ ) were also recorded. The average and the
standard deviation for each of these features across all instances of
the query-click pair were recorded and used as features. Features
were aggregated per URL, per site, per query-URL pair, and per
query-site pair. The output of each of these steps was a query and/or
URL/site pair with an associated set of around 20 features grouped
into the following classes: (i) SERP: Descriptive features of HR

As a baseline we use LambdaMART (with 500 decision trees
and learning rate of 0.1) on over 500 features including page and
query content, hyperlink structure, and aggregated search activity.
This gave us a competitive baseline against which to measure the
impact of HR features. We train on a set of over 500k queries (and
10M query-URL pairs), validate on 60k queries, and test on a set of
16k queries – with no overlap between the query sets. The queries
in the datasets were sampled from Bing logs. Query-URL pairs
were labeled with five-point relevance judgments from trained
human judges as mentioned earlier. We added HR-based features
to the baseline ranker, retrain, and measure the relevance of the
top-ranked results. We experimented with adding features for each
aggregation strategy (URL, query-URL, etc.) separately and report
on the performance relative to the baseline.

Data Analysis

To understand the associations between physiological changes and
searcher interests, we computed the correlations between each of
four feature classes and three popular proxies for interest or relevance: (i) Dwell Time: Median duration in seconds on the landing
page for this query aggregated over many users, computed based on
time from click to the next recorded action; (ii) Relevance Judgments:
A rating of the landing page relevance for the query provided by
trained human judges as part the standard Bing relevance assessment process. Relevance ratings were provided on a five-point
scale: Bad, Fair, Good, Excellent, and Perfect, and; (iii) Clickthrough
Rate (CTR): The rate with which the landing page is clicked for the
query when returned in its search results, based on a heldout set of
12 months of logs from September 2014 to August 2015.
Table 2 reports the correlations between each feature class and
the measures of interest or relevance. We pooled all features in
each class into a single list and compared their values with the measures. HR features are fairly well correlated with each of the three
measures. The SERP and Transition feature classes are particularly
well correlated. One explanation is that SERP might capture some
of the interest in the landing page before the result click occurs, e.g.,
information residing in the result caption. The Transition feature
class could reflect the impact of the click on searcher physiology.

Experimental Results

3.2.1 Overall Performance. We now present the results across
all 16k queries in our test set. We use normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) to measure relevance [10] at each of the
top five rank positions. Table 3 presents the percentage gain in
NDCG at each of the top-five rank positions using each feature
aggregation strategy. Absolute NDCG numbers are proprietary.
The results show that performance improves as the aggregation
strategy becomes more specific, e.g., query-URL generates the most
significant gains within the covered query segment, while still covering a significant fraction of the test queries (16.4%). Inspecting
the evidential weights in the learned model we find that two classes
are especially important: SERP and Transition (matching the trends
in Table 2) with additional contribution from landing page features
and deviation from the normal HR for the current user.

3 RANKING USING HEART RATE
3.1 Models and Experimental Setup

3.2.2 Topic Effects. Physiological changes can distinguish emotive responses to certain stimuli [4]. We therefore wanted to understand whether topic affected the utility of HR features in ranking.
To do this, we obtained topic classifications for around 16% of the
queries in the test set by joining them with a separate set of Bing
logs, where queries were already classified into top-level Open Directory Project (ODP, dmoz.org) categories (e.g., Health, Sports)
using methods similar to [2]. Table 4 presents the ranking results,
in terms of the percentage change in NDCG over the baseline at

To learn effective rankings and to explore the importance of features
related to HR, we use the LambdaMART algorithm [18]. LambdaMART is a state-of-the-art ranking algorithm based on boosted
regression trees. Compared with other ranking approaches, it is typically more robust to sets of features with widely varying ranges of
values, such as categorical features. Since LambdaMART produces
a tree-based model, it can be used as a feature selection algorithm
or to rank features by their importance (Section 3.2.1).

each of the top-five rank positions (using the query-URL feature aggregation strategy, which had the best performance in the previous
section), across each top-level ODP category.
Topics with little effect on NDCG from HR signals, or strong
negative changes, are especially interesting since they deviate from
the overall trends in Table 3. The “Reference” and “Society” topics
may not stimulate a strong physiological response. Searches related
to “Health” and “News” may be associated with a heightened HR
before the click (e.g., in the case of health anxiety or reaction to a
news headline), which directly contradicts the HR profile shown in
Figure 1 (where the HR is expected to increase only after the result
click has occurred). The extent of the per-topic differences suggest
that we need further studies on how search topic affects HR.

DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS

We have demonstrated the potential of large-scale physiological
sensing to signficantly improve retrieval performance. The strong
performance was obtained using longitudinal data from a relatively
small set of 23k users for whom HR data was consistently available. The learned ranking model was not personalized, offering a
considerable advantage: it could scale to all search engine users.
Looking ahead, we will focus on personalized result ranking [3]
for a small set of Bing users for whom rich physiological data are
available. We focused on heart rate given its broad availability
across many wearables. Future work should explore more physiological signals, e.g., galvanic skin response, skin temperature, and
the utilization of signals from different wearables.
We found topic-dependent performance differences, meaning
that selective application of the ranking model could be valuable.
Although the findings rely on being able to track physiology from
many users, the magnitude of the observed gains may make it
viable for search engines to recruit panels of wearable device users
to collect large quantities of physiological and search data. Targeted
recruitment of individuals with specific interests, HR profiles, or
usage patterns, and learning dedicated per-cohort ranking models,
may help further amplify the relevance gains we observed.
