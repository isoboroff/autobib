ABSTRACT

reactions. We assume that, these emotional reactions (love, haha,
wow, angry, sad) associated to a web resource (document) can be
seen as clues that indicate a resource interest beyond a social network or a community. The research questions are the following:
(1) How users use these reactions to interact with resources?
(2) What is the impact of Facebook reactions on IR?
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2
reviews some background and related work. Section 3 presents a
statistical analysis on Facebook reactions. Section 4 describes our
social approach. Section 5 reports on the results of our experimental evaluation. Finally, Section 5 concludes this paper with some
perspectives.

A large amount of social feedback expressed by social signals (e.g.
like, +1, rating) are assigned to web resources. These signals are
often exploited as additional sources of evidence in search engines.
Our objective in this paper is to study the impact of the new social
signals, called Facebook reactions (love, haha, angry, wow, sad) in
the retrieval. These reactions allow users to express more nuanced
emotions compared to classic signals (e.g. like, share). First, we
analyze these reactions and show how users use these signals to
interact with posts. Second, we evaluate the impact of each such
reaction in the retrieval, by comparing them to both the textual
model without social features and the first classical signal (likebased model). These social features are modeled as document prior
and are integrated into a language model. We conducted a series
of experiments on IMDb dataset. Our findings reveal that incorporating social features is a promising approach for improving the
retrieval ranking performance.

BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK

This section reports: (1) some background information about social
signals and; (2) related work that has leveraged social signals to
measure a priori relevance of a resource.

CCS CONCEPTS

2.1

• Information systems → Document filtering;

Social signals represent one of the most popular UGC (User Generated Content) on the Web. Indeed, the Web pages include buttons
of different social networks where users can express whether they
support, recommend or dislike content (text, image, video, etc).
These buttons which describe social activities’ actions (e.g., like,
share, +1, etc) are related to specific social networks (e.g., Facebook,
Google+, etc) with counters indicating the rate of interaction with
the Web resource. In February 2016, Facebook introduces additional
emotional signals (reactions), allowing users to interact with posts
(resources) across love, haha, wow, angry, and sad (see Figure 1).
These reactions are an extension of the like button, to give users
more ways to express their feelings towards a post in a quick and
easy way. The goal of these new signals is to encourage users to
react even if the contents are difficult to like as in the case of disasters, gloomy news, death, emotion on movie. Table 1 summarizes
the most popular signals on social networks.

INTRODUCTION

Majority of information retrieval (IR) systems exploit two classes
of features to rank documents in response to the user query. The
first class, the most exploited, dependents on the query, it concerns
term statistics such as term frequency, distribution of term in documents. The second class concerns query-independent features,
which measures a kind of quality or importance of the document.
Among these factors, the number of incoming links to a document
[10], PageRank [5], topical locality [7], the presence of URL [13],
document authors [11] and social signals [1–3].
Most of existing approaches [2, 3, 6] exploit non-emotional signals such as (+1, share, tweet) to estimate the document prior by
considering the quantity of signals related to a resource. In this
paper we are interested in a novel type of signals, named Facebook

Exploiting Social Signals in a Search

Social signal assigned to a given resource can be interpreted as an
approval or disapproval of a resource, which can be used to measure
a rank of importance of a resource.

In this section, we conducted a preliminary study on how users use
these reactions to interact with posts. We studied the reactions on 10
IMDb Top Box Office movies released in 2016 as well as 4650 articles
published on some famous International Media between March 2nd
and June 2nd , 2016: “The Guardian (UK)", “The Wall Street Journal
(USA)", “The New York Times (USA)", “The Washington Post (USA)",
“China Daily (China)", “The Times of India (India)", “The Sydney
Morning Herald (Australia)", “Fox News (USA)", “Dawn (Pakistan)",
“CNN (USA)". The number of each reaction for each post related
to media or movies is collected using Facebook API and parsing
Facebook pages.

News Title
Breaking: Belgium police at the airport at Zaventem told CNN that ’there has been an explosion’ and
’something has happened’.
Breaking News: At least 13 Killed in explosions at
Brussels airport, metro station, Belgian media report.
Multiple explosions reported in Brussels, Belgium.
Brussels airport explosion: Several feared dead,
shouts in Arabic.

According to Figure 2 that investigates reactions individually,
“CNN" and “Sydney Morning Herald" have the angriest following
with 71% and 73%, respectively. The “Times of India" had the saddest
following in response to the article post about the attack with 68%,
and “Fox News" followers were between the sadness (49%) and
the anger. Although there were some wow reactions, and a few
scattered love and haha reactions, (thankfully) they accounted for
fewer than one ten-thousandth of a percent of global reactions.
Finally, the use of reactions by Facebook users, we could have
the ability to measure sentiment in an even more dynamic way. The
like button already allows to know the contents that interested the
user. Now, with additional five emoji, we can record more nuanced
reactions. Through these reactions, the user provides information
about what he loves or what he gets angry. By considering all this
data, we can draw up a detailed profile of tastes and personality
of the user. Our study of these social reactions is only to understand how people use them. However, these new signals can be
exploited in sentiment analysis or considered as a priori knowledge
to estimate the relevance of the document in response to a user
information needs (see next section).

Overall in tables 2 and 3, we found that users in the world use
love reaction (40% for international media and 73% for IMDb Top
Box Office) of all reactions. Users were less likely to use the two
negative reactions (angry and sad) in movies, and funny reactions
(haha and wow) in media.
We also analyzed Facebook users reactions to the first breaking news report about the March 22 Brussels attack. In the early
morning of March 22, there were explosions in Brussels near the
Zaventem airport and a subway car. The first posts about the attack were very similar across several media. We have listed 4 news
published on official facebook pages of 4 media as well as the headline of the article that they linked to in their posts (see Table 4).
Although the posts were made early morning, they received an
average of 4200 total reactions. We found that with this highly
emotional tragedy, users were more likely to use reactions other
than like signal. In fact, the “CNN" and the “Fox News" followers
used nonlike reactions more than they liked.

Facebook, Twitter

While several works have been exploiting users feedback there
is still lack of studies that would analyze users’ signals coming from
specific social networks. Major existing works [2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 14]
focus on how to improve IR by exploiting users’ actions and their
underlying social network. The most related work to ours is [12],
which leveraged user feedback about YouTube videos for the task
of affective video ranking. The videos are represented with senticfeatures (based on the primary emotions) as well as other social
features, and the queries are again assumed to include an explicit
emotion statement.Learning to rank approach is used, which allows
to compare the performance of different sets of features.
Our work has a similar motivation as those previous efforts, i.e.,
harnessing social features around a Web document to improve relevance ranking of conventional text search. However, our approach
attempts to exploit and evaluate the impact of emotional signals in
the retrieval ranking.

IMPACT OF REACTIONS ON IR

Our approach can be useful for the queries that explicitly state
a certain emotion (like “romance movies by...”, “happy videos of
cats”). Indeed, using fine-grain emotional signals rather than a
simple count of like, can improve IR where the user’s information
need is related to her affective needs.

Our approach consists of exploiting Facebook reactions as prior
knowledge to take into account in the search ranking. Textual
relevance of a document is combined with its social importance
estimated through these users reactions.
Social information exploited within the framework of our model
is represented by < U , C, R > where U ={u 1 , u 2 ,...uh }, C={D 1 , D 2 ,...D n }
and R={r 1 , r 2 ,...rm } are finite sets of instances: Users, Documents and
Reactions, respectively.

Textual Relevance and Document Priors

Textual model is used to estimate the relevance of a document to a
query. Our approach combines the social document prior P (D) and
the relevance status value RSVt ex tual (Q, D) between query Q and
document D as follows:
rank

RSV (D, Q ) = P (D) · RSVt ex tual (Q, D)
Y
rank
= P (D) ·
RSVt ex tual (w i , D),

(1)
(2)

w i ∈Q

Sinister

where w i represents term in the query Q and RSVt ex tual can be
estimated with different models such as BM25 and language model.
The document prior P (D) is useful for representing and incorporating other sources of evidence to the retrieval process. Our main
contribution is a method to estimate P (D) by exploiting Facebook
Reactions.

4.2

EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION

To validate our approach, i.e. evaluate the impact of Facebook reactions on IR, we conducted a series of experiments on INEX IMDb1
dataset (167,438 documents, 30 topics and qrels). Each document
describes a movie, and is represented by a set of metadata, and has
been indexed using keywords extracted from textual fields such
as (title, plot, actors, etc).For each movie, Facebook reactions are
collected via its API using movies URLs (see table 5).The nature of
these signals is a counting of each reactions on movies.In our study,
we focused on the top 1000 results for each topic.

We compared our approach which combines social document
prior with Hiemstra language model [8], to the baselines LM.Hiemstra
without using any document priors, as well as like-based model (like
as document prior). We note that the best value of the smoothing
parameter µ ∈ [90, 100].

Estimating Priors

5.1

The priors are estimated by simply counting the number of reactions
performed on the documents. Assuming that these features are
independent, the general formula for P (D) is:
Y
P (D) =
P (r i ),

Results and Discussion

Table 6 compares the different configurations of our approach in
terms of precision@k (k ∈ {10, 20}), nDCG@1000 and MAP. Different configurations are evaluated, by taking into account Facebook
reactions individually and grouped according to their meaning:
positive or negative emotions (labeled + or − in table 6, respectively). Label (*) indicates a statistically significant improvement
overs LM.Hiemstra with the significance level of 0.05.
a) Impact of Reactions Individually. The best results are obtained by the reactions Love and Wow with 0.4122 and 0.4031 in
terms of P@10, respectively. Some topics such as “romance movies
by Leonardo DiCaprio or Tom Cruise” and “romance movies by
Richard Gere or George Clooney” are registered the highest precision when the reaction Love is taken into account in the ranking
process (with 0.8801 and 0.9112 in terms of P@10, respectively).
The reaction Wow is more effective with topics that represents a real
fact or a freaky and exciting information such as “true story event
movies” that registered a precision at ten of 0.7754. The reactions

P (r i ) =

where |r i (D)| is the number of reactions of type r i on document
D and |r • (D)| is the total number of reactions on document D.
Further, we use Dirichlet to smooth P (r i ) by collection C to avoid
zero probabilities. This leads to:
Y |r i (D)| + µ · P (r i |C) !
P (D) =

Haha and Sad provide the lowest results compared to like-based
model, but they bring significant improvements compared to textual
model LM.Hiemstra. The Angry is the weakest feature, it is close
to a negative signal that is associated much more with irrelevant
documents.

Love (0.33) has the highest correlation, followed by number of Wow

correlated with relevance. This results justifies the results obtained
above (see table 6) and confirms that these novel emotional signals
contribute to the improvement of the retrieval performance. Indeed,
the well positioned resources have a high number of reactions and
the frequently loved or funniest content is increasingly correlated
with good ranking of relevance.
Finally, these results show that Facebook reactions are fruitful
for IR systems, and can be more effective for specific search that
take into account emotional aspect in the retrieval. Consequently,
grouping these signals according to their meaning, where some
signals are positive and related to the document reputation, is more
effective compared to the individual consideration of signals to
improve IR. We also note that the impact of these reactions is
related to the nature and the emotion expressed in the topics.

CONCLUSION

This paper studied the impact of novel signals related to Facebook
users’ reactions (love, haha, angry, wow, and sad) on IR. By analyzing
these reactions, we notice that they present a positive growing.
They allow to better understand if the user enjoyed the content
or not. We proposed to estimate document priors by considering
these reactions as an additional source of evidence to measure
document relevance. Experimental evaluation conducted on IMDb
dataset shows that taking into account these social features in a
textual model improves the quality of returned search results. The
correlation analysis shows that positive reactions are positively
correlated with relevance.
For future work, we plan to estimate the impact of these reactions in sentiment detection with respect of their creation dates.
Further experiments on another dataset are also needed. Unfortunately, until now, these social features are not yet available on other
documents of standard dataset such as INEX Social Book Search.

b) Impact of Grouped Reactions. The prior based on grouped
reactions improve significantly the results in terms of nDCG compared to the LM.Hiemstra, especially when using positive reactions
(Love, Haha)+ : +29% and (Love, Haha, Wow)+ : +34%, as well as compared to the consideration of reactions individually. We can also
notice that when negative reactions are grouped, the relevance of
the returned documents becomes very low. This amounts to a lack
of topics that expresses appropriate emotions to Sad and Angry. In
our case, we have only this two IMDb topics “Worst actor century”
and “Chernobyl” that have registered a significant P@10 (0.7126
and 0.7610, respectively). This type of features can be helpful to
capture non-relevant documents when the topics are positives. In
addition, the reaction Wow is even more effective when considered with positive reactions group (Love, Haha, Wow)+ : +34%, +10%
against textual model and like-based model, respectively.
c) Correlation Between Reactions and Relevance. In order to
analyze Facebook reactions and determine if there is a link (dependence/independence) between them and the document relevance,
we conducted a correlation study using Spearman’s Rho correlation
coefficient [4].
