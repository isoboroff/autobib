ABSTRACT

shops imply business opportunities for investors. Take the fast food
industry as an example, the revenue of this industry has grown from
six billion dollars in 1970 to 200 billion dollars in 2015 in the United
States1 . Excluding inflation2 , the revenue in the fast food industry
has increased five times, which indicates more consumptions and
increasing business shops, implying opportunities for investors.
Nevertheless, discovering business opportunities of new shops
is difficult for investors. Opening what kind of business at which
place is a tough decision. Even when investors are smart and lucky
to find a good location such as a venue near the subway station and
try to open a fast food shop for the commuters, it is hard to decide
which kind of fast food to provide, sandwiches or fried chickens?
The means of surveys can solve this problem to some extent. But the
expense is not affordable to most of business owners and investors,
except for some big chain retailers.
Fortunately, the emerging location-based social networks (LBSNs)
show possibilities to mine business opportunities for investors.
LBSNs play important roles in each citizen’s daily lives with the
increasing use of smartphones, which record the behaviors (e.g.,
dining, exercising, and shopping) of millions of people acting in different kinds of business venues. As a result, the LBSN data provide
an alternative way to understand the crowd instead of delivering
surveys to them. Moreover, compared with delivering surveys in
several limited locations, the LBSN data make it possible to consider
the business decision from a big picture of the whole city, rather
than limited investigated areas.
In this paper, we mine the business opportunities from the LBSN
data through recommending new business categories for a specific
district, which guides the investors to decide to open what kind
of business at which place. First, we partition a city into different
districts, which helps to decide where to open a new shop. In particular, we define the properties of a business district and propose
a greedy algorithm to discover business districts in a city. Furthermore, we define the business mining problem and propose the
EmbeddingWARP algorithm to recommend new business categories
for a specifically partitioned business district. We propose an embedding model [10] to learn category latent representations, which
capture the functional correlations among different categories. Next,
we model the interacting relations between a district and a category
through the collaborative filtering technique. Then, we propose
a Weighted Approximate-Rank Pairwise (WARP) loss [13] based
ranking model to recommend business categories for a specific
business district on the grounds of the learned category representations. To verify our system, we conduct experiments on Yelp data.

Urbanization’s rapid progress has modernized a large number of
human beings’ lives. This urbanization progress is accompanied
by the increase of a variety of shops (e.g., restaurants and fitness
centers) to meet the increasing citizens, which means business
opportunities for the investors. Nevertheless, it is difficult for the
investors to catch such opportunities because opening what kind of
business at which place is not easy to decide. In this paper, we take
this challenge and define the business opportunity mining problem,
which recommends new business categories at a partitioned business district. Specifically, we exploit the data from location-based
social networks (LBSNs) to mine the business opportunities, guiding the business owners to open new commercial shops in certain
categories at a particular area. First, we define the properties of
a business district and propose a greedy algorithm to partition a
city into different districts. Next, we propose an embedding model
to learn latent representations of categories, which captures the
functional correlations among business categories. Furthermore, we
propose a ranking model based on the pairwise loss to recommend
categories for a specific district. Finally, we conduct experiments on
Yelp data, and experimental results show that our proposed method
outperforms the baseline methods and resolves the problem well.

INTRODUCTION

Urban development has mostly changed human beings’ lives. In the
process of urbanization, many people migrate into the cities, and
then new business shops are opened in the communities to meet
the explosively increasing citizens. Such intensive needs for new

people gathering; 2) venues in a district are geographically adjacent to the center location. In the process of a business district’s
formation and expansion, new business shops are needed, which
implies the business opportunities we are pursuing. Therefore, the
key points of mining business opportunities constitute two steps:
1) discovering different districts, which guides where to open the
business; 2) recommending the appropriate categories for a specific
district, which guides to open what kind of business.
To sum up, we aim to predict what kind of businesses are needed for a partitioned business district. Before the formal problem
definition, we define two basic terms as follows.

Experimental results show that our proposed method resolves the
problem well.
We summarize the contributions as follows. 1) To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work mining the business opportunities
for business owners based on LBSN data. Specifically, we define the
business mining problem and propose a system to help business
owners to discover commercial opportunities of new business categories from LBSNs. 2) We first define the business district property
and propose a greedy algorithm to discover the business districts.
This algorithm partitions a city into different districts, which helps
to specify locations for business. 3) We propose a system for the business mining problem, which recommends new business categories
for a specific business district based on the learned category embedding representations. Experimental results show that our proposed
method successfully addresses the business mining problem.

Definition 1 (Business Venue). A business venue is a shop v, with
geographical latitude and longitude ⟨lat, lon⟩, and a category set Cv
containing categories labeled to the venue v.
Definition 2 (Business District). A business district Vd is an
aggregation of different business venues, in which venues are geographically adjacent to each other.

RELATED WORK

LBSN applications. LBSNs play an important role in each citizen’s
daily lives with the increase of smartphones. Popular LBSNs such as
Yelp and Foursquare, have attracted millions of users and hundreds
of thousands of business shops. To improve user experience and
prosper the businesses in LBSNs, a variety of new applications come
out, e.g., point-of-interest (POI) recommendation and retail allocation system. On the one hand, through mining the user check-in
data, POI recommendation systems [14, 15] are proposed to improve user experience, helping users to explore new places through
the LBSNs. In addition, researchers mine the user check-in records
and social preference to help make new friends in LBSNs [9, 12].
On the other hand, some researchers exploit the business data to
serve the business owners in LBSNs, proposing the zone recommendation system [8], business prediction system [1], and retail
allocation system [4, 6].
Connection with prior work. Our work employs the business
data to mine the commercial opportunities of new shops for business owners in LBSNs. For mining the business opportunities, studies in [1, 4, 6, 8] involve two limitations. First, the studies in [1, 4, 6]
consider a limited number of given locations. Although Lin et al. [8]
consider a city as a whole, they recommend locations coarsely based on zones partitioned in the government city plan. Second, the
work [4, 6] is designed for allocating chain stores, constrained in a
specific categorical business type. The studies [1, 8] can cover more
categories. Nevertheless, they recommend the business category
based on the similarity, which ignores the correlations among business categories (e.g., partner-marketing relations) that have been
proven to be important [2]. Therefore, methods in [1, 4, 6, 8] cannot
resolve the business opportunity mining problem well.

The business mining problem aims to discover emerging business
venue categories in a business district Vd . In practice, a business
venue v contains at least one category type. Thus, a category set
Cv contains at least one element. In addition, a business district Vd
contains several venues, which may consist of the same or different
categories. Therefore, a business district Vd contains a series of
categories, forming a set CV . Each element c ∈ CV appears in the
district Vd with different times counting based on the number of
venues. Moreover, we assume that when a category attracts more
shops, this category indicates bigger commercial values. Now, the
business mining problem can be formally defined as follows.
Definition 3 (Business Mining Problem). The business mining
problem aims to recommend a category set C R for a business district
Vd , given existing category set CV and corresponding appearing times
of each category.

4.1 Discovering Business Districts
We propose a greedy business district discovering algorithm. The
discovered district should satisfy the following two requirements: 1)
the venues in the district are geographically adjacent to the center
venue; 2) the district should contain the business center in the local,
which is the center location playing the role of gathering crowds.
To discover the business districts, we first define the geographical
location graph, which captures the venues’ geographical topological
properties.
Definition 4 (Geographical Venue Graph). Given venues in a
city as a vertex set V , the geographical venue graph G is constructed
by generating edges among any two vertex pair ⟨vi , v j ⟩, whose geographical distance is less than a distance threshold.

PROBLEM DEFINITION

In the urban development, people usually gather for a specific target
such as study, work, and travel. Different kinds of business venues
are ensuingly open to satisfy the commercial needs of these people,
which naturally forms a business district for a specific function,
for instance, business districts around a university. From this phenomenon, we observe, 1) district forms based on a center location,
e.g., the university, which contains a specific function attracting

Based on the defined venue graph G, the business districts discovering algorithm aims to find a graph cutting method satisfying
the two requirements. To satisfy requirement 2, we need to find
the business center first. As the LBSNs attract millions of people
to record their daily lives via check-in activities, the number of
check-ins reflects a business venue’s ability to attracting the crowd.

Hence, we define the landmark venue as the business center in the
local as follows.

of categories Ci . Suppose ci denotes the embedding of a category
Í
c i , we denote each venue vector vi = |C1 | c i ∈Ci ci . Therefore, the

objective function of the category embedding model is as follows,

most checked-in location in a business district Vd .

With Definition 4 and Definition 5, the business district discovering algorithm could be elucidated as follows. Denote Vc as the
set of discovered districts, then the target of our business district
discovering algorithm is to find Vc , given the geographical venue
graph G. First, we sort all the venues according to the check-in
frequency to ensure landmark venue locating in the local business
district in later operations. Next, we visit venues with the sorted
order and treat the visited venue as landmark venue to construct
a business district. We employ the breadth-first search (BFS) to
visit the geographical venue graph G and select the venues whose
distances to the landmark venue are less than the threshold dt . As
a result, the landmark venue and the selected venues constitute a
business district Vd .

4.2.1 Learning Category Representations. To capture the correlations of different categories, we propose an embedding model to learn the category representations. Our model is based on
two assumptions: 1) categories belonging to the same venue are
highly correlated, and 2) adjacent venues in the geographical venue
graph (Definition 4) are highly correlated. Borrowing the idea from
network embedding [3, 10], we propose the category embedding
learning model. To satisfy assumption 1, we use the categories labeled the same venue to represent the venue together through an
average operator; furthermore, to satisfy assumption 2, we use the
neighbors in the geographical venue graph to represent each venue.
Formally, we formulate the category embedding model as follows.
Supposing that Vn = {v 1 , . . . , vk } denotes the neighbors of a venue
vi in the venue graph G. Then, the objective function is to maximize
the following log probability,
log Pr(v j |v i ).

4.2.2 Business Recommendation Model. Treating each business
district as a “user”, the business category as an “item”, and the
appearing times of each category as the “rating”, the business mining problem can be formulated as a traditional recommendation
problem. We are encouraged to employ collaborative filtering methods to recommend a category to the target district if the category
appears in some “similar” districts but not in the target district.
Thus, we propose a WARP loss [13] based latent ranking model to
recommend top-N new categories for a specific district.
We use ac,d to denote the occurrence number of a category c
at a district Vd . If the category does not appear in the district, we
set ac,d = 0. We assume that the bigger the occurrence number
ac,d is, the category c is more appropriate for the district Vd . Moreover, we use dd to denote the latent representation for district
Vd . The appearance of a category c at a district Vd is modeled by
ϕc,d = dd · cc , namely dot product of district and category latent
representations. Thus, for a category c appearing in a district d
with ac,d , the pairwise order can be measured as follows,

After partitioning a city into different districts, mining business
opportunities aims to predict emerging business categories for a
specific district by the correlations among different categories. To
address this task, we propose the EmbeddingWARP algorithm, in
which we first learn the category representations and then recommend new categories for a specific district through a WARP loss
based ranking model.

where L(r ) = ri=1 1i is a function converting the ranking order
into a loss. In this objective function, the category representation is
derived in the category embedding model, so our target is to learn
the district representations. To avoid overfitting we constrain the
district latent vector in a ball, ||dd ||2 ≤ S, for all Vd ∈ VD .
We use the learning scheme in [7] to learn the objective function.
Specifically, we iterate through each category c appearing in a
district d and sample a negative category c ′ to update the vectors.
Here, we use Bootstrap technique to generate samples. We assume
we get the negative category c ′ until the M t h sample, satisfying
(ac,d − ac ′,d )(ϕc ′,d + ϵ − ϕc,d ) > 0. Then, we use the stochastic
gradient descent (SGD) algorithm to learn the latent factors of
districts. Denote δ (x) = σ (x) ∗ (1 − σ (x)), where σ (·) is the sigmoid
function. The gradient of Lwar p with respect to the latent factor of
district Vd is as follows:
∂Lw ar p

= L( ⌊
⌋)δ (ϕc ′,d + ϵ − ϕc,d )(cc − cc ′ ).

The latent factor is updated as : dd = dd + η ∂d
, where η is the
d
learning rate. After the update, we project the weights to satisfying
| |d | |
the constraint ||dd ||2 ≤ S, dd = dd Sd 2 .
Once latent representations of districts have been learned, we
measure the appropriateness of a category c at a district Vd by

where V is the venue set and (·) is the inner product operator.
In order to efficiently learn the objective function, we adopt
negative sampling to improve the optimization [10]. For each venue
vi , we sample a set of K venues Vs that are not adjacent to vi .
Moreover, we leverage the category embedding representations to

EXPERIMENTS

In this section, we conduct experiments on the LBSN data from
the Yelp dataset challenge 2015. We extract information about local
businesses in four cities, including Pittsburgh, Charlotte, Phoenix
and Las Vegas. To recommend meaningful categories, we ignore the
parent category label in a group of category labels for a venue. For
example, when a business venue is labeled with “Sandwiches and
Restaurants", we ignore the “Restaurants" and adopt “Sandwiches"
as the target category for the venue.

After discovering business districts, recommending categories
for a district is a classic recommendation problem. Compared with
general recommendation methods, the proposed EmbeddingWARP
model captures the correlations among categories, which makes
our proposed algorithm achieve the best performance.

We partition the city into different districts and generate the discovered districts for each city shown in Table 1. Compared with
the official neighborhoods partition, our partition is more finegrained. For instance, the city of Phoenix contains 15 urban villages

district and propose a greedy algorithm to partition a city into
different districts. Then, we propose an embedding learning based
rank model to predict emerging categories for a specific district. In
the future, we will employ knowledge from other cities to boost
the recommendation performance using transfer learning.

We handle the business mining problem with two steps: discovering business districts and recommending categories for a specific
district. For discovering business districts, we set the distance threshold as one kilometer. For the discovered districts, we filter the
districts with less than five venues, because those sporadic business
venues do not compose real districts. Then, for the selected districts,
we randomly choose 80% venues for training and the remaining 20%
for testing. We use general metrics in recommendation systems,
precision and recall, to evaluate our system.
After discovering business districts, recommending new categories for a district is a typical recommendation problem. Treating
the occurrence number of a category in a district as one kind of
implicit feedback, we can recommend categories for a district using
state-of-the-art recommendation methods. Therefore, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we compare the
proposed model with the following baseline methods, Random
Selection, Most Popular, BPRMF [11], and WRMF [5].
