Alignment includes (but is not limited to) the semantic annotation
process such as entity linking of short keyword queries or relation
extraction for satisfying information needs. It also includes information integration, ontology matching, entity search, and knowledge
graph selection based on an information need.
Utilization includes (but is not limited to) using knowledge graphs
and semantics in text-centric tasks. Examples are utilizing the
knowledge graph to improve document retrieval, question answering, factoid search, dialogue systems, event tracking, and retrieval
of complex answers.
We aim to bring together researchers and practitioners within the
IR field and related communities to discuss ongoing research and
best practices with the goal of addressing open research challenges
of this area. The missions of KG4IR include the following.
• Facilitate meetings for researchers working on acquisition,
alignment, and utilization of knowledge graphs for text
retrieval and analysis.
• Serve as an incubator for long-term research on resource
construction and end-to-end utilization.
• Act as a nursery for future tasks, applications, and evaluations that benefit from knowledge graphs and text retrieval.
• Provide a voice and platform to the community.

ABSTRACT
Knowledge graphs have been used throughout the history of information retrieval for a variety of tasks. Technological advances in
knowledge acquisition and alignment technology from the last few
years gave rise to a body of new approaches for utilizing knowledge
graphs in text retrieval tasks. It is therefore time to consolidate
the community efforts in studying how knowledge graph technology can be employed in information retrieval systems in the most
effective way. It is also time to start a dialogue with researchers
working on knowledge acquisition and alignment to ensure that
resulting technologies and algorithms meet the demands posed by
information retrieval tasks. The goal of this workshop is to bring
together a community of researchers and practitioners who are interested in using, aligning, and constructing knowledge graphs and
similar semantic resources for information retrieval applications.

OVERVIEW

The past decade has witnessed the emergence of publicly available
knowledge graphs (KGs) such as DBpedia, Freebase, and WikiData
and also proprietary KGs such as Google’s Knowledge Graph and
Microsoft’s Satori. The availability of large knowledge graphs and
grounding techniques have given rise to successful approaches
for many information retrieval (IR) tasks. It has been shown that
heterogeneous information in knowledge graphs and entity annotations can help to significantly improve information retrieval tasks.
In particular, the semantics encoded in knowledge graphs have
been effectively integrated in various aspects of IR systems, including query representation [7, 8, 13, 26], retrieval models [7, 18, 21],
learning-to-rank [25], and generic representations [21].
This workshop focuses on the end-to-end utilization of knowledge graphs and semantics in text retrieval and IR-related downstream applications. The scope includes suggestions for acquisition, alignment, and utilization of knowledge graphs and semantic resources for the purpose of optimizing end-to-end performance
of information retrieval systems.
Acquisition includes (but is not limited to) knowledge graph population and semantic resource construction with a special focus on
enabling IR-related techniques and applications. Examples include
domain/task-specific knowledge graph construction, knowledge
representation, and query-time knowledge extraction.

RELATED WORK

Acquisition. Knowledge graphs are either semi-manually constructed (Cyc [16], Freebase [4]) or machine-generated, for example using Wikipedia (DBpedia1 , Yago2 ). Supervised and unsupervised relation extraction algorithms [10, 20] provide an alternative
for the construction or augmentation of knowledge graphs [9].
Through cross-references, knowledge graphs form the linked open
data cloud.3
Alignment. A key ingredient for utilizing knowledge graphs are
algorithms that align knowledge graph elements to natural language text. Given text passages, entity linking algorithms identify
mentions of knowledge graph entities. While popular algorithms
like “TagMe!” [11] can be applied to many documents, specialized
entity linking algorithms for tweets and queries have received much
attention [3, 6, 19]. A byproduct of relation extraction algorithms
[10, 20] is an alignment between relation expressions in the text to
an edge in the knowledge graph. A related task is to find sentences
that describe a relation [24].
Entity search techniques aim to retrieve knowledge graph elements in response to an information need [14] and different variations on using fielded retrieval models or entity links in documents

have been developed [1, 23, 28]. Entity search is also utilized in
text-centric retrieval systems as a query-to-entity alignment component [7, 25], i.e., as a retrieval task in its own right.
Utilization. The utilization of knowledge graphs in text retrieval
and analysis tasks has been a recent breakthrough in information
retrieval. The rich semantics stored in knowledge graphs have
provided additional indicators for various components of search
systems. Although semantic search traditionally focused on search
within knowledge graphs [12], nowadays it is commonly generalized to include any “search with meaning” [2].
One utilization is to enrich query and document representations
with entity links [21] and embedding spaces [8, 27] to derive new
similarity measures. A general latent space approach is to first
associate the query with relevant entities (using entity search),
then use entity-centric features for document ranking [7, 18, 25, 26].
Structural graph features provide additional information for the
retrieval of short documents [5].
Open areas. There are many opportunities we have only begun
to study. While entity linking yields immediate success, utilizing
relation extraction for text retrieval is much more difficult [15].
Treating different aspects of entities appropriately is a promising yet
underexplored direction [17, 22]. Finally, widespread application of
knowledge-centric retrieval techniques hinges on the advancement
of knowledge graphs for new domains such as science,4 domainspecific entity linking,5 and complex answer retrieval.6
