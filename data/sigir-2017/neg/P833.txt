ABSTRACT
With the rapid development of mobile devices, point-of-interest
(POI) suggestion has become a popular online web service, which
provides attractive and interesting locations to users. In order to provide interesting POIs, many existing POI recommendation works
learn the latent representations of users and POIs from users’ past
visiting POIs, which suffers from the sparsity problem of POI data.
In this paper, we consider the problem of POI suggestion from the
viewpoint of learning geosocial multimedia network representations. We propose a novel max-margin metric geosocial multimedia
network representation learning framework by exploiting users’
check-in behavior and their social relations. We then develop a
random-walk based learning method with max-margin metric network embedding. We evaluate the performance of our method on a
large-scale geosocial multimedia network dataset and show that our
method achieves the best performance than other state-of-the-art
solutions.

The problem of POI suggestion has attracted considerable attention recently [2, 8]. Most of the existing works consider the POI
suggestion problem as content-based location recommendation
task, which learns the latent representations of users and POIs in
GMN from users’ check-in behaviors, and then suggest the right
POIs to users [17]. Although existing POI suggestion methods have
achieved promising performance, most of them still suffer from
the insufficiency representation of POI contents and the sparsity
of users’ check-in data. Currently, most of existing POI suggestion
methods [2, 8] learn the latent representations of users and POIs
by approximating the binary user-POI rating matrix (each 0/1 in
the matrix indicates whether a user has checked in at a POI) such
that the max-margin metric is embedded in the representations for
POI suggestion. However, the representation learning methods are
mainly based on the hand-crafted features of POI contents such
as POIs’ tags and photographs. Recently, various multimodal deep
representation methods [16] have been proposed for encoding the
multimodal contents into the joint representation. Since the POIs’
contents are multimodal, it is nature to employ the deep multimodal neural networks to learn their joint representations. On the
other hand, we employ the categories of POIs for discriminative
representation learning in order to gain better POI representation.
The sparsity of users’ check-in data is also a challenging problem
for POI suggestion. Each GMN user only visits a few POIs and thus
the user-POI matrix is very sparse. Fortunately, with the prevalent
of online social networks today, it is not difficult to find the social
relations between GMN users. Following the popular homophily
hypothesis, it is natural to assume that users’ relations shows a
strong evidence for their common preference. Thus, leveraging
both users’ social relations and their POI check-in behaviors are
essential for tackling the sparsity problem.

INTRODUCTION

With the increasing popularity of mobile devices and Web 2.0 technology [10–12], geosocial multimedia network (GMN) has become
a geographical web service that enables users to share their checkin behavior and photographs with geotagging [9, 15]. We have
witnessed the popular GMN sites such as Foursquare and Gowalla.
POI suggestion is an important component in GMN sites, which
provides attractive and interesting locations to GMN users [3–5].

with photographs and tags. We construct the connection between
POIs and users by their check-in behaviors. The friendship relation
between users u1 and u3 is also illustrated in Figure 1.
Using the notations above, we define the problem of POI suggestion from the viewpoint of learning max-margin network representation as follows. Given the set of POIs L, users U , and the geosocial
multimedia network G, we aim to learn the representations of POIs
and users, such that the max-margin metric is implicitly embedded
in the representations for POI suggestion.

In this paper, we consider the problem of POI suggestion from
the viewpoint of learning max-margin metric GMN network representation. We first introduce the multimodal neural networks
for the POI representations under their categories. We then propose a random-walk based learning method with the introduced
multimodal neural networks to jointly learn the representation of
GMN users and POIs, such that the max-margin metric is implicitly
embedded for POI suggestion. The main contributions of this paper
are summarized as follows:
• Unlike previous studies, we introduce the problem of POI
suggestion from the viewpoint of learning max-margin
metric geosocial multimedia network representation. We
learn the representations of users and POIs from GMN
network with multimodal neural networks, such that the
max-margin metric is implicilty embedded in the network
representation for POI suggestion.
• We employ a random-walk based learning method with
multimodal neural networks to learn the max-margin network representations for POI suggestion in GMN network.
Our learning method is scalable for large-scale GMN networks which is easily parallelized.
• We evaluate the performance of our method using the
dataset collected from the well-known geosocial multimedia network Gowalla and Flickr, and then show that our
method achieves the best performance than other state-ofthe-art solutions.

POI SUGGESTION VIA LEARNING
MAX-MARGIN MULTIMEDIA NETWORK
REPRESENTATION

In this section, we first present the problem of POI recommendation from the viewpoint of max-margin heterogeneous network
representation, and then introduce the max-margin network representation learning framework, illustrated in Figure 2.
We first construct the geosocial multimedia network by integrating the POIs’ contents, users’ check-in behaviors and their
social relations, illustrated in Figure 2(a). We next sample the paths
from GMN network as the context window for learning the vertex
representation using the random-walk method in [13], shown in
Figure 2(b). We introduce the proper multimodal neural network to
learn the POI representations. We first employ the convolutional
neural network for the visual representations of POIs’ photographs.
As there may be multiple photographs for each POI, we merge
their representations by adding an additional max-pooling layers,
illustrated in Figure 2(c). For the semantic representations of POIs’
tags, we utilize the pre-trained word embedding and then add an
additional mean-pooling layers to merge the tag representations,
shown in Figure 2(c). We then set up the multimodal fusion layers to
learn the joint POI representations, which connects the POI’s visual
representation and semantic representation into the same shared
fusion space, and then add them together to obtain the activation
of the multimodal fusion layer, given by

NOTATIONS AND RELATED WORK

Before reviewing previous work, we first introduce basic notions
and terminologies for POI suggestion and network representation,
then present the problem of POI suggestion. Given a set of POIs
L = {l1 , . . . , ln }, we denote the collections of their associated photographs by I = {i1 , . . . , in } and associated tags by T = {t1 , . . . , tn }.
We then denote the category of POIs by C = {c 1 , . . . , c n } where
c i is the category of the i-th POI. We take the last hidden layer
of the convolutional neural networks from POI’s associated photographs as the visual representations by X = {x1 , . . . , xn } and the
average of tag embeddings from POI’s associated tags as semantic
representations by Y = {y1 , . . ., yn }. We then denote the shared
representations of the multimodal POIs by Z = {z1 , . . . , zn }, where
zi is the fused representation vector of visual representation xi
and semantic embedding yi . We next consider the set of the user
model representations by U = {u1 , . . . , um }, where ui is the embedding vector for the i-th user model representation. We denote
the friendship relation between users by matrix S ∈ Rm×m , where
the entry si j = 1 if the i-th user and the j-th user are friends, otherwise si j = 0. We then consider the check-in relation between users
and POIs by W ∈ Rm×n , where the entry w i j = 1 if the i-th user
checks-in the j-th POI, otherwise w i j = 0.
We denote the propose the geosocial multimedia network by
G = (H , E) where the set of nodes H consists of the joint representations of POIs, and users, the set of edges are composed of
both the friendship relations S and check-in relations W . We now
illustrate a simple example of geosocial multimedia network in
Figure 1. The u1 , u2 and u3 are users, I1 , I2 , I3 and I4 are POIs, and
c 1 , c 2 are the categories of POIs. The content of POIs is associated

zi = д(Qv xi + Qs yi ),
where the matrices Qv and Qs are the weights for projecting the
visual representation and semantic representation into the shared
space. We employ the element-wise scaled hyperbolic tangent function д(·) for merging the projected representations.
We now introduce the objective function for learning max-margin
network representations based on the sampled paths and introduced
multimodal neural networks. Given the sampled paths, illustrated
in Figure 2(b), we consider them as the context window for vertex
representation learning. For each vertex in the sampled path hi , we
now present the its loss function as follows:
( P
l 1 (hi , u j ) + α · l 2 (hi , c i ), hi ∈ L
l (hi ) = Pu j ∈P,Wji =1
2
hi ∈ U
u ∈W −h i ∥u − hi ∥ ,
where the max-margin metric loss l 1 (·) is for users checking-in
certain POIs and the max-margin metric loss l 2 (·) is for learning
the POI representation with its category information, and α is the
tradeoff parameter. Thus, we instantiate the loss l 1 (·) by
l 1 (hi , u j ) = max(0, m 1 − hTi uj ), hi ∈ L,

We now present the training process of the proposed max-margin

the training loss terms of the objective function. We next denote

EXPERIMENTS

In this section, we conduct several experiments to show the effectiveness of our method on POI suggestion. We collect the geosocial
network from Gowalla [1] and obtain the multimedia POI contents
from Flickr, and then construct the geosocial multimedia network.
The dataset will be released for further study. Following the experimental setting of the POI suggestion problem in [2, 6–8], we
employ the Precision@K and Recall@K to evaluate the effectiveness of the POI suggestion methods. We compare our proposed
methods with other state-of-the-art methods CLR [7], STLR [6],
CAPRF [2], GEOMF [8], CNNMSE [14] and DeepWalk [13] for the
problem of POI suggestion.
Figures 3(a) and 3(b) illustrate the precision and recall of all algorithms using 80% training data, respectively. Tables 1, 2, 3 and 4
show the evaluation results of all methods using Precision@5, Precision@10, Recall@5 and Recall@10, respectively. The evaluation
were conducted with different ratio from the training data from
20%, 40%, 60% to 80%. We report the average value of all methods
using both Precision@K and Recall@K evaluation criteria. These
experiments reveal a number of interesting points:

• The social POI suggestion method CAPRF also obtains
good results, which demonstrates that the effect of social

CONCLUSION

In this paper, we present the problem of POI suggestion from the
viewpoint of learning max-margin GMN network representations.
We propose the GMN network that exploits POIs’ side information,
users’ check-in behaviors and their social relations for POI suggestion. We introduce the random-walk based learning method M 2 NL
with multimodal neural networks for learning GMN network representations, such that the max-margin metric is implicitly embedded
in the representations for POI suggestion. The extensive experiments illustrate that our method can achieve better performance
than several state-of-the-art solutions to the problem.
