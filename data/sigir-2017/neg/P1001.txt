ABSTRACT

Popular:10%
Unpopular:90%

Predicting the popularity of Point of Interest (POI) has become increasingly crucial for location-based services, such
as POI recommendation. Most of the existing methods can
seldom achieve satisfactory performance due to the scarcity of POI’s information, which tendentiously confines the
recommendation to popular scenic spots, and ignores the
unpopular attractions with potentially precious values. In
this paper, we propose a novel approach, termed Hierarchical
Multi-Clue Fusion (HMCF), for predicting the popularity
of POIs. Specifically, we devise an effective hierarchy to
comprehensively describe POI by integrating various types of
media information (e.g., image and text) from multiple social
sources. For each individual POI, we simultaneously inject semantic knowledge as well as multi-clue representative power.
We collect a multi-source POI dataset from four widely-used
tourism platforms. Extensive experimental results show that
the proposed method can significantly improve the performance of predicting the attractions’ popularity as compared
to several baselines.

spots actually receive high evaluation from the tourists, which
implies the precious values of these unpopular spots may be
substantially underestimated.
POI popularity prediction aims at analyzing the popularity
condition in the next period of time based on the features of
scenic spots. This research not only improves the accuracy
of POI recommendation and route planning for visitors, but
also provides reference information to mine commercial value
hidden in the unpopular spots. Recently, considerable studies
principally focus on popularity prediction of Web content like
tweets [1, 2, 7], images [6, 9, 12] and videos [3, 10]. Related
work involving popularity of scenic spots like [4] ignores
that attractions with freshness and uniqueness are likely to
be discovered by travelers and become popular in the near
future.
However, there are three main challenges for POI popularity prediction working on real-world data. 1) The description
information of POI in social network is very sparse, even
in widely-used websites. 2) Visual ambiguity is common in
different types of scenic spots. For instance, it is difficult to
distinguish picking garden from natural scenery only through
their images. 3) It is non-trivial to effectively integrate multiple social clues for modelling POIs.
In this paper, we propose to integrate various types of
social UGC content from multiple sources to model POIs.
Moreover, we propose an effective hierarchical approach to
alleviate the problems of data sparsity and visual ambiguity,
thereby optimizing POI popularity prediction. The hierarchical structure contains “Topic Layer”, “POI Layer”, “Feature

INTRODUCTION

Tourism is an important industry to national economy and
world economy. However, through the analysis of data from
several travel websites, we notice that the distribution of
travelers is uneven among the scenic spots. This characteristic
of scenic spots’ popularity exhibits the long tail effect, which
is depicted in Figure 1. In fact, most of these unpopular

first two layers complete preliminary classification by means
of semantic information, the third layer achieves prediction
based on multi-clue fusion. We obtain tag for each POI in the
last layer. Specifically, we utilize two types of feature fusion
strategies, i.e., directly concatenation of multiple features
and projecting multiple features to the same feature subspace.

• We establish our real-world POI dataset by collecting several types of user generated content from multiple sources,
which underpins the solution of enhancing the comprehensiveness of POI description, i.e., handling the sparsity
problem.
• We propose a POI modelling method based on a hierarchical structure with four specific layers, where we take POIs’
semantic information and multi-modal representation into
consideration simultaneously. Thus, we are able to complete popularity prediction through double classification.
• We achieve multi-clue fusion by means of multi-view learning for the subsequent POI popularity prediction.

DATA COLLECTION

We build a multi-source POI dataset by integrating content of
a specific province in China from four main-stream tourism
platforms, i.e., Dianping1 , Mafengwo2 , TripAdvisor3 and
Qunar4 . For each POI, we collect its comments, descriptions,
photos, and rating grade.
Specifically, we obtain all the textual and visual content of
4009 scenic attractions in Sichuan province of China during
2006 to 2016. The total number of texts and images is
respectively more than 100,000 and 600,000. To facilitate
comparison experiment, we randomly sample 70% of POIs
as training data to predict the popularity of the remaining
POIs. Through the analysis of description matrix for POIs,
we notice that the sparsity of our real-world dataset is around
6%, which is fairly challenging for POI popularity prediction.

where φk,w means the wth word of the kth topic. Besides,
we select 10 topics to ensure small similarity between each
topics and high clustering degree of words in every topic,
thus avoid redundancy of topics.

LDA model θ ∈ RW ×K as:

To explore the correlation between the topics and POIs, we
utilize the probability model to construct the “POI Layer”.
Given any POI, we first calculate the topic probability as

3.1.4 Tag Layer. The number of comments is possible
to reflect the popularity of a tourist attraction. Through
analysing the number of POIs’ comments in different stages,
we notice that the number of nearly 90% attractions’ comments is less than 25. In view of the unpopular attractions
account for nearly 90% of all POIs, we set the number of
comments to 25 as the boundary between popularity and unpopularity. Besides, we utilize the comments before and after
2014 to reflect the popularity of POIs in the past and present.
The change of popularity indicates that all the attractions
can be divided into four types: from popular to popular,
from popular to unpopular, from unpopular to popular, from
unpopular to unpopular. We denote the four types as p → p,
p → u, u → p, u → u, respectively.

3.1.3 Feature Layer. In feature layer, we construct two
types of POI features, i.e., visual feature and textual feature. For visual feature, considering that different POIs have
different numbers of visual samples (e.g., images), we propose to use pooling strategy to generate bag-of-visual-word
representation for POI data. The main steps are as follows.
1) We choose VGGNet as our feature extractors to obtain
image feature vectors; 2) Then we perform clustering over all
the training image feature vectors to generate “codebook”.
A codeword in image codebook is defined as the center of
a cluster; 3) Thus, each image feature vector of a POI datum is mapped to a certain codeword. Similarly, we employ
word2vec model to extract feature for word and generate
textual feature for POI data.
As to the fusion of multiple features, we utilize two kinds
of feature fusion strategies, i.e., early fusion and late fusion.
While early fusion (EF) directly concatenates text feature
and image feature to produce single feature vector for each
POI, late fusion tries to map multiple features to the same
feature subspace to achieve consistency of fusion. Two typical methods, CCA [11] and MVSSDR [8], are respectively
used in this step. The basic idea of CCA method is to find
projection directions to maximize the linear correlation between two different kinds of variables. The MVSSDR method
uses pairwise constraints to derive multiple embeddings in
multiple views, then seeks the linear transformation to make
embeddings from different spaces pattern comparable.

(7)

It considers two distinct SVMs in respective feature spaces,
which are sequences of projection directions found by KCCA.
wA , bA (wB , bB ) are determined by the first (second) SVM
and are the solution to final optimisation problem.

EXPERIMENTS

We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical
approach as compared to several baseline methods.

4.1

Baselines

In order to validate the effect of proposed hierarchical approach, we implement the following comparison schemes:
•

Popularity Prediction

Based on the above hierarchical structure, POI popularity
prediction can be considered as a classification task. The
process of constructing “Topic Layer” and “POI Layer” is
a preliminary classification process based on semantic representation. Then we conduct classification by using multiple
features in “Feature Layer” to predict popularity. Each POI
is labelled as one of the four types defined in “Tag Layer”.
For classifier, we choose SVM for simplicity. When we
use early fusion strategy, the prediction is straightforward
using the outcome of the classification of SVM. When we use
late fusion strategy, we merge the classification outputs of
various classifiers. For instance, in SVM-2K [5], we obtain

SVM-2K v.s. Hierarchy + SVM-2K (hSVM-2K)
Early Fusion (EF) v.s. Hierarchy + Early Fusion (hEF)
CCA v.s. Hierarchy + CCA (hCCA)
MVSSDR v.s. Hierarchy + MVSSDR (hMVSSDR)

Each comparision approach is implemented based on SVM
classifier.

Evaluation Metrics

To quantitatively evaluate the performance of POI popularity
prediction, three evaluation metrics are employed in our
experimentation. We respectively list them as follows.
• Accuracy (Acc). Acc is a conventional metric used to
evaluate the correct classification result.

Results

We present the experimental results of proposed method and
several baselines on our collected multi-source POI dataset.
In Figure 3, four sets of ROC curves are plotted in our
comparison schemes. To demonstrate the performance of
HMCF in quantitative value, Figure 4 and Figure 5 report
the Acc and AUC of different methods respectively. In terms
of Acc, all methods (SVM-2K, EF, CCA, MVSSDR) with
HMCF achieve 2.59%, 5.13%, 4.88%, 4.10% relative improvement respectively as compared to original methods, which
clearly indicates the effectiveness of the hierarchical strategy.
For AUC, our HMCF approach also achieves significant improvement. Specifically, the hCCA substantially outperforms
other methods and increases the value by 25.8% relatively
as compared to CCA. Note that hCCA achieves the best
performance in our experiment, which shows the advantage
of hCCA in popularity prediction based on our real-world
dataset.

prediction, which facilitates existing POI recommendation
methods by mining unpopular attractions with potential precious values. We proposed a novel and effective hierarchical
POI modeling strategy which simultaneously utilizes semantic content as well as multi-clue representation of POIs. In
multi-clue fusion, we fully exploited various types of UGC
content from multiple sources. All experimental studies were
