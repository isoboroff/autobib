of this toolkit formed the basis of the Microsoft Research entry in the TREC 2009 conference [3]. Given the implementation in a declarative, high-level language, these algorithms
are easy to modify and extend making them a good basis for
research into new algorithms.
In addition to discussing the use and implementation of
this toolkit during the demonstration, we intend to release
it [5] in source and binary form to others in the community to
aid in large-scale information retrieval research. This, coupled with the public availability of the ClueWeb [2] dataset
and the Dryad/DryadLINQ system [4] makes large-scale web
information retrieval research substantially more accessible.

EXTENDED ABSTRACT

Due to the explosive growth of the web that has occurred
throughout its history, many researchers working on web
corpora have begun to move toward distributed, data parallel computing. The size of the ClueWeb09 [2] corpus, at approximately one billion documents, is an indication of this.
Even limiting the collection to only documents in the English language only halves the size of the collection.
In this work, we describe the collection of information retrieval algorithms we have implemented using DryadLINQ [8].
DryadLINQ is a data parallel processing system that allows programmers to write distributed programs without
worrying about the implementation of a distributed system. DryadLINQ executes programs containing SQL-like
Language Integrated Query statements (LINQ) by shipping
the computation to nodes in the cluster for parallel execution. The ability to break a computation into many pieces
that can be processed on individual machines means that
even a small number of computers can be leveraged to reduce the time necessary to process large collections.
When researchers first obtain a collection of web documents, there is a substantial amount of preprocessing before
analysis can commence. The toolkit assists with parsing,
link extraction, associating discovered anchor text with the
referenced document. Once the document content and links
are in a standard format, then further processing can be
performed. The toolkit provides implementations of textbased retrieval methods (BM25 [7] and BM25F [9]), queryindependent link based scoring functions (PageRank, indegree, and trans-domain indegree), query-dependent linkbased scoring functions (SALSA-SETR [6]). Additionally,
the toolkit provides an implementation of shingle based duplicate document detection [1], n-gram extraction, and a
mechanism to build an inverted index.
The algorithms included in this toolkit include both traditional algorithms as well as recent research results. Elements
