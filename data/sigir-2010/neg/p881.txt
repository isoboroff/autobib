ABSTRACT
Reading and Commenting online news is becoming a common user
behavior in social media. Discussion in the form of comments
following news postings can be effectively facilitated if the service provider can recommend articles based on not only the original news itself but also the thread of changing comments. This
turns the traditional news recommendation to a “discussion moderator” that can intelligently assist online forums. In this work,
we present a framework to recommend relevant information in the
forum-based social media using user comments. When incorporating user comments, we consider structural and semantic information carried by them. Experiments indicate that our proposed
solutions provide an effective recommendation service.

the form of comments. Concerns and intention of active users may
change as the discussion continues. Therefore, news recommendation, if it were only based on the original posting, can not benefit
the potentially changing interests of the users. Apparently, there
is a need to consider topic evolution in adaptive news recommendation and this requires novel techniques that can help to capture
topic evolution precisely to prevent wild topic shifting which returns completely irrelevant news to users. A related problem is
content-based information filtering (or recommendation). Most information recommender systems select articles based solely on the
contents of the original postings [1] [3] [4].
In this work, we propose a framework of adaptive news recommendation in social media. It has the following contributions. (1)
It is the first attempt of incorporating reader comments for adaptive
news recommendation. (2) We model the relationship among comments and that relative to the original posting in order to evaluate
their overall impact on recommendations.

INTRODUCTION

Web is one of the most important vehicles for “social media”,
e.g. Internet forums, blogs, wikis, and twitters. One form of social media of particular interest here is self-publishing. In selfpublishing, a user can publish an article or post news to share with
other users. Other users can read and comment on the posting and
these comments can, in turn, be read and commented on. Digg
(digg.com) and Yahoo!Buzz (buzz.yahoo.com) are commercial examples of self-publishing. A useful extension of this self-publishing
application is to add a recommendation feature to the current discussion thread. That is, based on the original posting and various
levels of comments, the system can provide a set of relevant articles, which are expected to be of interest of the active users of the
thread.
Here, we explore the problem of news recommendation for dynamic discussion threads. A fundamental challenge in adaptive
news recommendation is to account for topic divergence, i.e. the
change of gist during the process of discussion. In a forum, the
original news is typically followed by other readers’ opinions, in

SYSTEM DESIGN

The proposed news recommender first constructs a topic profile
for each news posting along with the comments from readers, and
uses this profile to retrieve relevant news.
We first model the relationship among comments and that relative to the original posting in order to evaluate their overall impact.
In our model, we treat the original posting and the comments each
as a text node. This model both considers the content similarity
between text nodes and the logic relationship among them. On one
hand, the content similarity between two nodes can be measured by
any commonly adopted metric, such as cosine similarity and Jaccard coefficient. This metric is taken over every node pair in the discussion thread. On the other hand, the logic relation between nodes
takes two forms. First, a comment is always made in response to
the original posting or an earlier comment. In graph theoretic terms,
the hierarchy can be represented as a tree 𝑇 = (𝑉, 𝐸𝑇 ), where 𝑉
is the set of all text nodes and 𝐸𝑇 is the edge set. In particular, the
original posting is the root and all the comments are ordinary nodes.

There is a directed edge 𝑒 ∈ 𝐸𝑇 from node 𝑢 to node 𝑣, denoted
(𝑢, 𝑣), if the corresponding comment 𝑣 is made in response to comment (or original posting) 𝑢. Second, a comment can quote from
one or more earlier comments. From this perspective, the hierarchy can be modeled using a directed acyclic graph (DAG), denoted
𝐷 = (𝑉, 𝐸𝐷 ). There is a directed edge 𝑒 ∈ 𝐸𝐷 from node 𝑢
to node 𝑣, denoted (𝑢, 𝑣), if the corresponding comment 𝑣 quotes
from comment (or original posting) 𝑢. As shown in Figure 1, for
either graph 𝑇 or 𝐷, we can use a ∣𝑉 ∣ × ∣𝑉 ∣ adjacency matrix,
denoted 𝑀𝑇 and 𝑀𝐷 , respectively, to record them. Inline with the
adjacency matrices, we can also use a ∣𝑉 ∣ × ∣𝑉 ∣ matrix defined on
[0, 1] to record the content similarity between nodes and denote it
by 𝑀𝐶 . Thus, we can combine these three aspects linearly.
Intuitively, the important comments are those whose topics are
discussed by a large number of other important comments. Therefore, we propose to apply the PageRank algorithm [2] to rank the
comments as
∑
𝑠𝑗 = 𝜆/∣𝑉 ∣ + (1 − 𝜆) ×
𝑟(𝑐𝑖 , 𝑐𝑗 ) × 𝑠𝑖 ,

𝑃 @10
𝑀 𝐴𝑃

where 𝜆 is the damping factor as in PageRank and this value is
recommended to be 0.85, 𝑖 and 𝑗 are node indices, and ∣𝑉 ∣ denotes
the number of text nodes in the thread. In addition, 𝑟(𝑐𝑖 , 𝑐𝑗 ) is the
normalized weight of comment 𝑐𝑖 referring to 𝑐𝑗 defined as

𝑐𝑗

𝑀𝑖,𝑗
,
𝑀𝑖,𝑗 + 𝜖

where 𝑀𝑖,𝑗 is an entry in the graph adjacency matrix and 𝜖 is a
constant to avoid division by zero.
Once the importance of comments on one news posting is quantified by our model, this information along with the news itself are
fed into a synthesizer to construct a topic profile of this news discussion thread. The profile is a weight vector of terms to model
the language used in the thread. Consider a news posting 𝑑0 and
its comment sequence {𝑑1 , 𝑑2 , ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ , 𝑑𝑚 }. For each term 𝑡, a compound weight 𝑊 (𝑡) is calculated. It is a linear combination of the
contribution by the news posting itself, 𝑊1 (𝑡), and that by the comments, 𝑊2 (𝑡). The weight contributed by the news itself, 𝑑0 , is:
𝑊1 (𝑡) = 𝑤(𝑡, 𝑑0 )/max
𝑤(𝑡′ , 𝑑0 )
′
𝑡

4.

The weight contribution from the comments {𝑑1 , 𝑑2 , ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ , 𝑑𝑚 } incorporates not only the language features of these documents but
also their importance of leading a discussion in related topics. That
is, the contribution of comment score is incorporated into weight
calculation of the words in a text node.
𝑊2 (𝑡) =

𝑚
∑
𝑖=1

𝑖

Such a treatment of compounded weight 𝑊 (𝑡) is essentially to recognize that readers’ impact on selecting relevant news and the difference of their influence strength.
With the topic profile constructed as above, we can use it to select relevant news for recommendations. That is, the retriever returns an order list of news with decreasing relevance to the topic.
Our model to differentiate the importance of each comment can be
easily incorporated into any good retrieval model. In this work, our
retrieval model is derived from [4].

CONCLUSION

In this work, we present a framework for adaptive news recommendation that incorporates information from the entire discussion thread. This study can be extended in a few interesting ways.
For example, we can use this technique to process personal Web
blogs and email archives. The technique itself can also be extended
by incorporating such information as reader scores on comments,
chronological information of comments, and reputation of users.
Indeed, its power is yet to be further improved and investigated.

collected from Digg and Reuters news website. We randomly select
20 news articles with corresponding reader comments from Digg
website. These news articles with different topics are treated as the
original news postings, recommended news are selected from a corpus of articles collected from Reuters news website. This simulates
the scenario of recommending relevant news from traditional media to social media readers for their further reading. We compared
the proposed approach to three other retrieval approaches as the
baseline: one is a simple content filter (CF) which treats news and
comments as a single topic profile, the other two are well-known
news recommendation methods [1], Okapi and LM.
To observe the impact of readers’ concerns on original news
posting in social media, we investigate the effect of the three forms
of relationship among comments, i.e. content similarity, reply, and
quotation. We carry out a series of experiments for this purpose.
we find that replies are slightly more effective than quotations and
both of these outperform pure content similarity. In other words,
the importance of comments can be well evaluated by the logic
organization of these comments. We also notice that the incorporation of content similarity decreases the system effectiveness. This
may seem to contradict our intuition that the textual information
should complement the logic-based models. By further investigating our results, we find that content similarity sometimes misleads
the decision on the importance of the comments. Besides, the computation cost of calculating the content similarity matrix 𝑀𝐶 is
very high. Therefore, we only apply the structural information to
determine the importance of each comment.
We have 𝑡-tests using 𝑃 @10 and MAP as performance measures,
respectively, and the 𝑝 values of these tests are all less than 0.05,
which means that the results of experiments are statistically significant. We conduct a series of preliminary experiments to find the
optimal performance obtained when the topic file word number is
60 and combination coefficient 𝛼 is 0.7. As shown in Table 1, the
overall performance of the proposed approach performed significantly better than the best baseline methods.
