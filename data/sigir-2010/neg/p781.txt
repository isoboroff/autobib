assumptions: A focused retrieval system guides a user to the
relevant content, and the user starts browsing the document from
the passages indicated by the system [1,2]. Returned passages are
browsed first and the browsing continues until T2I is reached.
With this model, effectiveness measures like precision and recall
can be calculated for the document. These measures are
calculated based on the proportion of relevant text browsed at the
point where T2I is reached.

ABSTRACT
XML retrieval provides a focused access to the relevant content
of documents. However, in evaluation, full document retrieval has
appeared competitive to focused XML retrieval. We analyze the
density of relevance in documents, and show that in sparsely
relevant documents focused retrieval performs better, whereas in
densely relevant documents the performance of focused and
document retrieval is equal.

We compare focused XML retrieval with document retrieval by
taking into account the access point to the document, browsing
order and T2I. We analyze the effectiveness of retrieval at the
level of a retrieved relevant document. More specifically, we
examine the effectiveness by the density of relevance in
documents. Our hypothesis is that focused retrieval provides a
more effective access to the relevant content of a relevant
document than full document retrieval, especially when it comes
to sparsely relevant documents.

2. DENSITY AND DISTRIBUTION OF
RELEVANCE

1. FOCUSED ACCESS TO A DOCUMENT
Ideal information retrieval (IR) systems would return only
relevant information to the user. In traditional document retrieval,
returned documents typically include both relevant and nonrelevant content. Approaches like passage and XML retrieval aim
at returning the relevant content more accurately: the user should
be guided directly to the relevant content inside the document
instead of having to browse through the whole document.
Surprisingly, in recent studies document retrieval has been found
a competitive approach to focused XML retrieval according to
retrieval effectiveness [e.g. 7]. However, some essential features
in focused access to a document have been overlooked: the order
of browsing, the user’s reluctance to browse non-relevant
information and the proportion of relevant text in documents. In
the present study this proportion is referred to as the density of
relevance of the document.

As the test collection we use the frozen Wikipedia collection [3]
of more than 650,000 documents covering various subjects. The
collection is used with topics and relevance assessments of the
INEX 2008 initiative [6], where relevant passages (in 4,887
relevant documents) for each topic (totally 70) are assessed. All
the relevant documents are sorted according to their ratio of
relevant text to all text, i.e. how many percent of the document’s
text is relevant. Then the sorted list of documents is split into
deciles, each covering 10% of the documents. The (rounded)
lower boundaries of the density (relevance ratio) for the deciles
are 0.005%, 2.4%, 6.6%, 12.1%, 24.4%, 58.4%, 94.9%, 99.3%,
99.7% and 99.9% (dec 1, dec 2,…, dec 10 respectively). That is,
the last 4 deciles i.e. 40% of the relevant documents have a very
high relevance density. Obviously, focused access to those
documents does not bring any improvements.

An XML retrieval system provides retrieved and assumedly
relevant passages first to the user. If a returned passage turns out
to be non-relevant, the user will not necessarily browse it through
but rather continues with the next result. This user behavior is
combined to effectiveness evaluation in the tolerance to
irrelevance (T2I) metric [4], which models the user interrupting to
browse after a given amount of non-relevant information is
encountered. The sooner T2I is reached, the less the document
benefits the effectiveness in evaluation.
In this study, we follow a browsing model with the given

Figure 2: Average Recall (a), Precision (b), % browsed content (c) of relevant documents on each decile
with documents having only some relevant content, when T2I is
assumed. Namely, in many cases the browsing ends before the
relevant content is met. This leads to zero recall. On the other
hand, if the relevant content is pointed out accurately, the recall
for the document is typically 1 (100%). However, due to the
nature of T2I, where the browsing goes on with the non-relevant
material until the T2I is met the precision is always less than 1.

Figure 1 shows the average precision of the five smallest deciles
at percentages of the relevant documents’ running text. The
relevant content in the lowest deciles is somewhat steady across
the average document, which means the relevant content may be
at any location, whereas the fourth and fifth decile shows a slight
bias towards the beginning of a document. The remaining deciles
especially from 7 upwards draw a high, relatively straight line and
are left out for the readability of the lowest curves.

While we assume the T2I and browsing order in focused retrieval,
our findings differ from the previous studies, where the full
document retrieval has been a competitive approach [7]. This is
due to the densely relevant documents, where the focused retrieval
systems tend to retrieve only parts for why the recall per
document remains low. This has led into overemphasizing
precision, which is taken into account four times more than recall
in the official metrics (i.e. the F-Measure).

3. PRECISION AND RECALL WITHIN A
DOCUMENT
To study the benefit of focused retrieval strategy for the retrieval
within a document on each decile, we selected the retrieved
passages of each relevant document. These passages were
provided by the best performing run at INEX 2008 (RiCBest,
University of Waterloo [5]). Then we compared these focused
results with a document retrieval baseline, where each relevant
document is browsed sequentially. Figure 2 shows the average
recall, precision and the percentage of browsed content in the
relevant documents for each decile. The elem column refers to the
focused retrieval strategy (i.e. RiCBest) while the doc column
refers to the document retrieval baseline. We report figures on two
T2I points: 500 and 2000 characters. In other words the browsing
is expected to end when the user has bypassed 500 or 2000 nonrelevant characters. The amount of 500 characters corresponds
approximately to the next paragraph.

Figure 2c shows that the amount of browsed content is about the
same for both of the strategies when assuming the same T2I. That
is, the focused retrieval strategy does not reduce the amount of
browsed content. However, with that amount the precision (Figure
2b) and especially the recall (Figure 2a) of the browsed content
are notably higher with the focused strategy for half of the
relevant deciles (dec1-5). The documents after sixth decile are
uninteresting since they are densely relevant and neither browsing
order matters nor T2I is reached.

Focused retrieval is beneficial in locating the relevant content in
between non-relevant material. Therefore documents with high
relevance density are not interesting in the scope of focused
retrieval. The results show that the less relevant content, the better
the focused retrieval performs. In plain document retrieval, the
user is responsible for finding the relevant content within a
sparsely relevant document. This leads into poor performance
