In this paper, we propose to rank users according to their potential
interests on a given advertisement. Similar to the learning to rank
problem in the field of information retrieval for document
ranking, we consider our problem in the same framework by
treating “ads” as “queries” and “users” as “documents”. We
propose three types of features based on the user behavioral data
and the ad content. The behavioral data include users’ query
history and ad click history. The first type of features reflects the
direct content matching between users’ behavioral data and the ad
content. For the second type of features, we map both user
behaviors and ads contents into high-level topics and then
compute their topic similarity. Finally, the third type of features
gives some priori user behavioral statistics, e.g. global ad clickthrough rate (CTR), a high value of which indicates that the user
may have habit to view ads and perform clicks. Using these user
behavior oriented features, we use a subset of ads together with
users who ever viewed or clicked these ads as training data to
learn a user ranking model. The experimental results show that
using our proposed features under a learning to rank framework,
we can well rank users who potentially interest in an
advertisement.

ABSTRACT
Behavioral Targeting (BT) is a recent trend of online advertising
market. However, some classical BT solutions, which predefine
the user segments for BT ads delivery, are sometimes too large to
numerous long-tail advertisers, who cannot afford to buy any
large user segments due to budget consideration. In this extend
abstract, we propose to rank users according to their probability of
interest in an advertisement in a learning to rank framework. We
propose to extract three types of features between user behaviors
such as search queries, ad click history etc and the ad content
provided by advertisers. Through this way, a long-tail advertiser
can select a certain number of top ranked users as needed from the
user segments for ads delivery. In the experiments, we use a 30days’ ad click-through log from a commercial search engine. The
results show that using our proposed features under a learning to
rank framework, we can well rank users who potentially interest
in an advertisement.

2. LEARNING TO RANK AUDIENCE

General Terms: Economics, Experimentation

Suppose an advertiser from a certain industry wants to run his ad
campaigns online and comes to an online ad publisher (e.g. a
search engine or an ad network). He knows much about his
products which are going to be advertised, but has no idea about
the online audience. There are billions of people on the Internet,
and hence it is impossible and unaffordable to deliver his ads to
all of them. Although he may buy some predefined user segments
with descriptions from the BT companies, the number of user
could be large for many long-tail advertisers. The cost of buying
user segments will exceed his budget. To make efficient use of his
budget, he wants to find a smaller part of best audience within a
user segment, and only displays ads to them during online
activities. To address this problem, we propose a user ranking
mechanism according to the advertiser’s ad campaigns.

1. INTRODUCTION
In recent years, user-targeted advertising is booming in industrial
circles by collecting and analyzing user data in many aspects such
as online behavior, demographic and geographic information.
Among various sources of user data, the richest user behavioral
data exhibit the biggest potential for further exploitation. Many
major search engines are providing Behavioral Targeting (BT) [1]
solutions to advertisers through acquiring BT companies or
bringing behavioral targeting technique into their existing
products. Generally speaking, the output of many BT solutions is
hundreds of user segments, within each of which users are
believed to have similar interests. Then, each segment is given a
snippet or name like “sports enthusiasts” for advertisers to judge
which segments they should buy for ads delivery. However, in
this way, the relatedness between the user segment and the
advertiser is assessed by human experience rather than from data
mining directly. Moreover, since a single user segment can have
millions of users, long-tail advertisers may not have enough
budgets to buy a complete segment. They are supposed to know
which part of users in a segment is the best audience desired by
them, which results in a user ranking problem.

Analogous to learning to rank documents in document retrieval
[2], in the user ranking problem, there should be queries,
document repository, relevance label definition and feature set. In
terms of learning to rank audience, the “query” is the
advertisement a. An online user u is treated as a “document”, with
the label l representing whether this user has viewed or clicked the
given ad, where l=-1 stands for the user u has never viewed a, l=0
stands for u has viewed a but did not click it, and l=1 stands for u
has viewed a and clicked it. In this work, we make use of two
types of behavioral data: user search query history and user ad
click history. Features are extracted from the ad and these
behavioral data simultaneously. We list the description of all three
types of features we propose to use in Table 1. Using this set of

features, which are represented by a feature vector x, for each
user-ad pair with label l, i.e. <u, a, l>, we can train a ranking
model under the learning to rank framework. And then, for any
new ad and all candidate users, we can rank the audience
according to their probability to click the given ad.

3. VALIDATION
For experiments, we use a dataset comes from a commonly used
commercial search engine which lasts for a full month. It contains
the fields such as user ID, query text of user, the displayed ad to
user, the clicked ad by user etc. We select 100 frequently clicked
ads from the ad repository for demonstration. We only consider
the users who have viewed and/or clicked these 100 ads for
ranking. To label users for experiments, if a user clicked an ad, he
is labeled as relevant to the ad; the users who have been displayed
the ad but did not click are labeled as irrelevant. For all users
correlate to the 100 ads, we create the profile for each user,
including the user query history and ad click history. Then, for
each ad, we extract the 14 features defined in Table 1to train the
ranking model. We randomly divide the whole user dataset into 5
folds and we run the experiments for 5 times. In each round, 1
fold is used as testing dataset and others are used for training.

Figure 1 shows the normalized distributions of relevant users in
the ranking list. The x-axis indicates positions in the ranked list.
The y-axis indicates the proportion of relevant users in a specific
position over the 100 ads. From the figure we can see that through
using our audience ranking solution, more relevant users are
ranked to higher positions.

Figure 1. The distribution of relevant users
Over the 100 ads and all related users in our dataset, the averaged
ad CTR is about 2.02%. After ranking, at the first position of each
ad, CTR of ad is as high as 16.7% and 11.2% at the second
position. This means we can well rank users who potentially
interest in an advertisement.

4. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we propose a novel user ranking problem to answer
“whom to deliver ads” for online advertisers. We utilize the user
behavioral data including user search query history and ad click
history to create the user profile. 14 features are defined and
extracted between user profile and the content of a given ad. We
then embed the user ranking problem into the learning to rank
framework and employ Ranking SVM to obtain the ranking
model. Experimental results show that our approach can
effectively rank the relevant users on top.

After surveying existing learning to rank methods, we choose
Ranking SVM [2] as our main method due to its proven efficacy
in prior research. Running Ranking SVM is equivalent to solving
the following optimization problem.
