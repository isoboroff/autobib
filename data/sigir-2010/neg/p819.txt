General Terms: Algorithms, Experimentation, Performance

yses are diÔ¨Écult to capture the hidden semantic relationships between the sentences and queries. Ontology, with
abundant concise concepts and rich domain-related information, can capture the hidden semantic information.
In this poster, we develop a novel method, OMS, to generate query-relevant summary from a collection of documents
by making use of the ontology. In particular, OMS Ô¨Årst
links the sentences of documents being considered onto a
domain-related ontology, then maps the given query to a
speciÔ¨Åc node in the ontology, and Ô¨Ånally extracts the summary from the sentences in the subtree rooted at the corresponding query node, by using FGB, a text summarization
approach described in [4]. As a byproduct, the summaries
we Ô¨Ånally acquire can be represented as a tree showing the
hierarchical relationships of the extracted sentences.
We apply OMS to disaster management for evaluation.
For natural calamities, such as hurricanes and earthquakes,
vast amount of related news and reports are generated through
time for broadcasting and recording events. Experimental
results on such disaster management demonstrate the eÔ¨Écacy of OMS.

ABSTRACT
In this poster, we propose a novel document summarization approach named Ontology-enriched M ulti-Document
S ummarization(OMS ) for utilizing background knowledge
to improve summarization results. OMS Ô¨Årst maps the sentences of input documents onto an ontology, then links the
given query to a speciÔ¨Åc node in the ontology, and Ô¨Ånally extracts the summary from the sentences in the subtree rooted
at the query node. By using the domain-related ontology,
OMS can better capture the semantic relevance between the
query and the sentences, and thus lead to better summarization results. As a byproduct, the Ô¨Ånal summary generated
by OMS can be represented as a tree showing the hierarchical relationships of the extracted sentences. Evaluation
results on the collection of press releases by Miami-Dade
County Department of Emergency Management during Hurricane Wilma in 2005 demonstrate the eÔ¨Écacy of OMS.

FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW

Figure 1 shows the framework of OMS. First of all, a domain speciÔ¨Åc ontology hierarchy was created by domain experts to describe concepts appearing in disaster related document sets. Given a collection of documents related to disasters, we disassemble them into a set of sentences. Then we
map these sentences onto the ontology hierarchy based on
their semantic correlations, discarding some sentences not
relevant to any concept in the ontology, and omitting from
the ontology some concepts with less importance.
Up to this point, we obtain an ontology-sentence tree representation in which each node is linked by a set of relevant
sentences. Given a query q, OMS links it to a speciÔ¨Åc node
i in the ontology-sentence tree according to the semantic
relationship between the query and the nodes, and extracts
a sub-hierarchy rooted at i. Then the FGB model [4] is
applied to summarize sentences linked to each node in this
subtree. Finally, a summary tree that satisÔ¨Åes the query q
is achieved.
Ontology ReÔ¨Ånement: In the ontology hierarchy, a
myriad of concepts relevant to disaster management documents are speciÔ¨Åed by domain experts. Given a subset of
documents, some concepts may not be predominant or even
not appear in this documents set. We need to reÔ¨Åne the
ontology hierarchy so that the ontology-sentence tree representation can better reÔ¨Çect the subject of the document set.

1. INTRODUCTION
Ontology is a philosophy concept, dealing with questions
about what entities exist or can be said to exist, and how
such entities can be grouped within a hierarchy, and subdivided according to their similarities and diÔ¨Äerences. Ontology has been applied in many research areas in information retrieval, particularly, in text mining. For example, D.
S¬¥
ùëénchez et al use the ontology to compute semantic similarity [1], and I. Yoo et al utilize the ontology to improve
document clustering [2]. However, relatively few research efforts have been reported on using the ontology for improving
document summarization.
Generally, given a query, multi-document summarization
is the process of generating a query-focused/relevant condensation (i.e., a generated summary) of the content of the entire input set. Existing summarization methods usually rank
the sentences in the documents according to their scores
calculated by a set of predeÔ¨Åned features, such as term
frequency-inverse sentence frequency (TF-ISF), sentence or
term position, and number of keywords [3]. The above analCopyright is held by the author/owner(s).

To do so, we Ô¨Årst rank nodes at the same level in order of
sentence counts, then ignore the nodes and their subtrees
with sentence counts less than the average. By iteratively
running the above procedure in a top-down manner, a thematic ontology-sentence tree representation is generated.

the topics in eclipses are domain concepts, and the sentences
linked to them are summaries correlating to concepts. We
observe that (1) every summary in the summary tree concretely reÔ¨Çects the status of relevant concept; (2) summaries
generated by OMS exhibit apparent semantic hierarchy.

Performance Evaluation

For performance evaluation, 42 queries related to some
speciÔ¨Åc concepts in the ontology are designed by domain experts for experimentation. In order to evaluate the quality
of the generated summaries by OMS and other methods, we
use human generated summaries as references. For hurricane
data, we hire 5 human labelers to manually create summaries
based on the selected document set and the given queries.
Then we run OMS on such document set; meanwhile, we
apply FGB [4] to automatically summarize query-relevant
documents without using ontology. The summarization results are evaluated by ROUGE, a document summarization
evaluation tool described in [5]. The experiment results are
shown in Table 1. The results indicate that summarization
eÔ¨Écacy is signiÔ¨Åcantly improved by adopting ontology.

3.1 Real World Data
The document set used in our experiments is a collection of press releases from Miami-Dade County Department
of Emergency Management and Homeland Security during
Hurricane Wilma from Oct. 19, 2005 to Nov. 4, 2005.
It contains approximately 1,700 documents, about half of
which contain similar contents. We randomly select 100 documents from this document set as our experiment data.
Data Preprocessing: For the sake of the theme embodiment of ontology-sentence tree representation, some sentences are removed from the whole sentences set in the procedure of sentence mapping, since they have no semantic
relationship with any ontology concept node. For example,
‚ÄúFor those outside of Miami Dade County can call (305) 4685900 to reach the Answer Center.‚Äù describes the phone number of the Answer Center; however, this kind of sentences
repeatedly appears in most disaster related documents we
are considering, and they have no speciÔ¨Åc meaning for summarization.
