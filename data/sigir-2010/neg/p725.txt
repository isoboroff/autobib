which describes the gap between the optimal rating for an
individual and the optimal rating for the group [6]. Both of them
can be easily calculated from the query logs.

ABSTRACT
The goal of predicting query potential for personalization is to
determine which queries can benefit from personalization. In this
paper, we investigate which kind of strategy is better for this task:
classification or regression. We quantify the potential benefits of
personalizing search results using two implicit click-based
measures: Click entropy and Potential@N. Meanwhile, queries
are characterized by query features and history features. Then we
build C-SVM classification model and epsilon-SVM regression
model respectively according to these two measures. The
experimental results show that the classification model is a better
choice for predicting query potential for personalization.

The value for Click entropy and Potential@N are generally
continuous, and the regression may be a good choice since the
goal of regression is to predict the value of continuous variables.
However, the previous studies [5] treat query potential prediction
as a classification problem which assigns an input query to one of
multiple discrete classes without any justification. The
classification approach, as a loose and approximate measure, is
robust and stable in prediction, while the regression model can
greatly help practical applications due to its nearly accurate
prediction. In this paper, we tentatively investigate which kind of
model is better for predicting query potential for personalization
on AOL (American Online) query logs. Results show that the
classification model is more effective than the regression model.

Keywords

To compare the classification and regression model for predicting
query potential for personalization, we choose Support Vector
Machine (SVM), a state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm, as
a fair framework of a case study. Though SVM is a classification
model in essence, it has been successfully extended into a
regression version. We apply C-SVM as the classification model
and epsilon-SVM as the regression model because they have
similar structural loss function and optimization method. After
that we evaluate and compare the performance of these two
models in a unified way.

Query potential for personalization, Classification, Regression

1. INTRODUCTION
In contrast to the traditional retrieval models usually focusing on
the topical relevance, a strong motivation of personalized Web
search is further to take the user relevance into account. It is a
subtle issue to implement a fully personalized Information
Retrieval (IR) model because of different requirements on the
same queries by users. A number of research groups have built
models personalizing search results by individual interests [1, 2,
3]. Regardless of the details, they typically apply the same
algorithm and parameter settings to all queries. However, Dou et
al. [4] reveal that current personalization models can improve the
results for some queries while actually harming others. This is
somewhat reasonable since personalization models can be
expected beneficial to queries with a substantial gap between the
personal requirement and the aggregate group preference.

Click entropy and Potential@N are two implicit measures which
quantify query potential for personalization by user clicks.
Assuming the user click as an indication for the relevance, these
measures regard that queries with great variations in the click also
have great variations in what people consider relevance. Click
entropy is calculated as:

Click Entropy(q) =− ∑ P(cu | q)*log2(P(cu | q))
URLu

To measure this kind of gap, Teevan et al. [5] examined the
variability among user intents by both explicit relevance
judgments and large-scale log analysis of user behavior patterns.
They found that the click-based implicit measures correspond well
with the explicit measures and suggested two implicit measures
assessing query potential for personalization. The first is Click
entropy, which measures the variability in clicked results across

(1)

where p(cu|q) is the probability that URL u was clicked on a query
q. In contrast, the Potential@N describes the potential gain that
can be achieved by personalizing rankings in terms of the NDCG
difference between the ideal individualized ranking and the best
group ranking. Note that N is the size of a group.
Both Click entropy and Potential@N are generally continuous
measures. Naturally, we can learn epsilon-SVM regression model
straightforward with the training data. For the classification task,
we follow the approach described in [5] and bin the data into four
equal-sized bins according to the above two measures. With such

believe that the classification is more suitable than the regression.

obtained gold standard for classification, the C-SVM is applied to
identify which bin a sample belongs to. To compare the two
models, we again divide the regression results into four equalsized bins in the same way, enabling a direct comparison with the
gold standard. Therefore, the precision of classification can be
chosen as the final evaluation metric for both models.

We employ similar query features and history features as in [5] to
predict Click entropy and Potential@N. Table 1 presents the
detailed features, which are extracted from the AOL query log.

This paper tentatively shows that query potential prediction is
more promising to be treated as a classification problem. We
follow the previous work and divide data into four equal-sized
bins. The comparison is made between C-SVM as a classification
model and epsilon-SVM as a regression model with query
features and history features. In the future, more substantial
comparisons between the classification and regression model
under other framework are scheduled. And we will enrich the
model with more features mined from query logs and other
resource to better resolve query potential prediction. Finally, the
way of classifying data into equal-sized groups deserves further
examination.

To verify which kind of model fits better for query potential
prediction, we look at a large sample of queries issued to AOL
(American Online) search engine from March 1 to May 31, 2006.
We extract queries which are issued by at least ten people to
ensure sufficient data to understand the variability across users on
the same query. Table 2 shows the statistics of the whole
collection and data for experiments.

We learn C-SVM and epsilon-SVM that best explain the training
data by libSVM toolkits [7]. The learning targets are Click
entropy and Potential@N. The group size is ten. We predict these
two variables using query features and history features. All results
are reported by using five-fold cross validation, as shown in Table
3 and 4. In these two tables, “q” denotes query features, “h”
means history features, “y” represents the features employed and
“n” indicates features removed. Following the work [5], we have
the data divided into four equal-sized bins, and the baseline of a
random guess is 25%.

According to Table 3 and 4, we can find that the results are
consistent in both the Click entropy and the Potential@10.
Compared with the baseline, we can somewhat identify queries
which benefit from personalization using query features alone,
although the overall level of prediction precision is moderate.
Meanwhile, we can find that the history features extracted from
query logs can strongly improve the effectiveness of both models
and produce a sizeable jump in precision. It should also be noticed
that in the case of using both query features and history features,
classification method is only slightly better, while about 5%
improvement using the query features only. Therefore, when
