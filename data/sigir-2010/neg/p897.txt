ABSTRACT

is calculated form past click logs. For new/rare ads, we do
not have any/sufficient past click data. Hence CTR for such
ads need to be predicted so that they can be ranked along
with other frequent ads. Richardson et. al. [5] predict the
CTR based on ad text, ad quality etc. Fain et. al. [4] predict the CTR based on term clusters. We propose similarity
features derived from click logs and advertisers hierarchy to
accurately predict the CTR for new ads.

Ads on the search engine (SE) are generally ranked based on
their Click-through rates (CTR). Hence, accurately predicting the CTR of an ad is of paramount importance for maximizing the SEâ€™s revenue. We present a model that inherits
the click information of rare/new ads from other semantically related ads. The semantic features are derived from
the query ad click-through graphs and advertisers account
information. We show that the model learned using these
features give a very good prediction for the CTR values.

INTRODUCTION

3.

Sponsored search can be seen as an interaction between
three parties - SE, User and the Advertiser. The user issues
a query to a SE related to the topic on which he/she seeks
information. Advertisers and SEs try to exploit the immediate interest of user in the topic by displaying ads relevant to
the query topic. Advertisers bid on certain keywords known
as bid terms and their ads may get displayed based on the
match between bid term and the user query. SEs try to rank
the ads in a way that maximizes its revenue.
Search engines typically rank ads based on the expected
revenue (ad (Rev)). Expected revenue from an ad is a function of both bid and relevance: ad (Rev) = Bidâˆ—Relevancead .
The relevace of an ad is measured using its CTR. The CTR
of an ad for a query is the no. of clicks normalized by no.
of impressions for that query. CTR of an ad is a function of
both ad and the query, i.e. an ad can have a different CTR
for different queries. The CTR value for an ad-query pair

DATASET

The dataset used in our experiments comprised 12 days
search log from Yahoo! search engineâ€™s US market. After
removing redundant fields, each record in the dataset contained following fields: 1.Query 2.Term Id 3. Creative ID
4.Adgroup ID 5.Campaign ID 6.Account ID 8.CTR. Fields
2-6 point to a unique ad. Creative id points to the ad text.
An ad text comprises bid term, title, abstract & display
URL. The CTR values are normalized by removing the position & presentation bias. After some preprocessing, we got
1,447,543 unique query-ad pairs from the click through logs.
It contained 1,97,080 unique queries and 9,43,431 unique
ads. We randomly divide this dataset into 65-25-10 ratio for
training, testing and validation respectively. We use Gradient boosted decision trees (GBDT) as a regression model [3].
Using validation set, the number of trees and no. of nodes
parameters of GBDT were set to 600 and 150 respectively.

FEATURES

Features from Query-ad click graph: These features
are based on the semantic relations of the queries and ads
with other similar queries and ads. Regelson [4] have shown
that similar ads (bid terms in their case) follow similar CTR
distribution. The idea here is to learn the CTR values of
query-ad pair from semantically similar queries and ads.
We derive the semantic similarity from the query ad clickthrough graph. The click graph is built from 12 days query
log (same period from which we generated our dataset).
Queries are represented as vectors and these query vectors
are compared to find similarity amongst the queries. A
query q is represented as a vector of transition probability
from q to all the ads in the graph. Edges are weighted using click frequency-inverse query frequency (CF-IQF) model:
cf iqf (qi , aj ) = cij âˆ— iqf (aj ).
The transition probability from a query to an ad, P (aj |qi ) =
cf iqf (qi , aj )/cf iqf (qi ). Each query is represented as q =
(P (a1 |qi ), P (a2 |qi ), Â· Â· Â· , P (an |qi )). The similarity between
two queries qi and qj is the cosine similarity between the
q~i âˆ— q~j
. This
two query vectors. Sim(qi , qj ) = Cosine

similarity is used to predict the CTR for new query-ad pair
by retrieving top k queries similar to qâ€™ and calculating the
weighted average of the CTR values for all the ads over query
qâ€™ as in [1]. Using query similarity,the CTR is estimated as:
X
CT R(qk ) âˆ— Sim(qi , qk )

The similarity between ads is also calculated in a similar
fashion, with each ad being represented by the transition
probability from ad to query P (qj |ai ) and similarity between
two ads is reffered as Sim(ai , ak ). Using ad similarity, The
CTR of is estimated as X

features. We call these features as AdH features. Detailed
explanation of all the features is available in [2].
Features from Query-ad lexical match: In an attempt to capture how relevant an ad is to the query, we
compute the lexical overlap between the query and these ad
units. We compute various text matching features such as
cosine similarity, word overlap, character overlap, and string
edit distance for each combination of unigrams and bi-grams.
We refer to this category of features as QADL. For all the set
of features we also consider log of each feature as a feature.
In all we have 50 features.
As shown in Table 1, Sim-Q & Sim-A give good improvements and when combined (Sim-QA) give an improvement
of 21.11%. In the AdH category, Campaign (Camp) gave the
best result and when Sim-QA was clubbed with Camp the
improvement over baseline reached 26.67%. Finally, lexical
feature did not yeild much improvement alone, but (SimQA+Camp+QADL) give the best performance with a good
28.61% improvement over the baseline. All these improvements are staistically significant at 99% significance level.
When all the features were ranked according to the feature
importance [3]. Features like Campaign, ACTR, log(ACTR),
No. of ads in campaign were amongst the top few.

CONCLUSIONS

We have proposed an approach to predict the CTR for
new ads based on the similarity with other ads/queries. The
similarity of ads is derived from sources like query ad clickthrough graph and advertisement hierarchies maintained by
the ad engine. The model gives good prediction on the CTR
values of new ads. Analysis of the featureâ€™s contribution
shows that the features derived from the ad hierarchy and
from the click-through graphs contribute the most to the
model followed by some of the word overlap features.

Features from Ad Hierarchy: Advertisements on an
ad engine are typically maintained in some kind of a hierarchy. One such hierarchy is shown in Fig. 1. There are
numerous reasons for maintaining ads in a hierarchy: (1)Advertiserâ€™s business may span various business units (BU).
Ads from the same advertiser but from different BUs are
maintained in different accounts. (2)For each BU, the advertisers can have ads on a range of products. Advertisements from the same account on similar products fall under
the same Campaign. (3)Adgroups do further granular classification of ads. (4) Finally, an ad comprises a bid term
and ad text (creative). Combination of these two makes an
ad. We aggregate ads at each level viz. Term, Creative, Adgroup, Campaign and Account, compute the average within
each group and use them as features in our model. In addition, number of featuers in each group are also taken as
