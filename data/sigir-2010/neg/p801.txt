tions on their textual content. For evaluation they use a
commercial, non publicly available set of artists, which has
been manually annotated by music experts.

We propose three heuristics to determine the country of origin of a person or institution via text-based IE from the Web.
We evaluate all methods on a collection of music artists
and bands, and show that some heuristics outperform earlier work on the topic by terms of coverage, while retaining
similar precision levels. We further investigate an extension
using country-specific synonym lists.

HEURISTICS

The first and simplest heuristic investigates estimates of
search engine’s page counts for queries containing the artist
to be classified and the country name. We use Google’s index
since this engine has already proven to yield respectable results for artist-to-genre classification tasks based on weighted
term features – cf. [5]. To mitigate the distortions arising
from artist names that equal common speech words1 , we
employ the query scheme "artist " "country " music. We
finally predict the country whose page count is highest for a
given artist, formally maxc pc(artist, c) ∀c ∈ C, where C is
the set of country names.
The second approach applies term weighting functions [1]
to the textual content of the 100 top-ranked Web pages retrieved from Google’s index for the person under consideration. We use the following term weighting measures since
they are well founded in IR research: document frequency
(df ), term frequency (tf ), and tf · idf of the country terms
in the set of artist-related Web pages. We conducted experiments with various tf · idf variants and found that the
following seems to be suited best for this particular task:

tf · idft,a = ln (1 + tft,a ) · ln 1 + dfnt

INTRODUCTION AND CONTEXT

The country of origin of a person or institution represents an
interesting aspect of his/her/its life/existence. It plays a vital role in understanding a person’s background and context.
As a semantic descriptor, the country of origin of a music
artist or band, both of which we will refer to as “artist” in the
following, can be used to query music collections based on
learned associations between acoustic features and textual
features – cf. [2, 6]
The “country of origin” of an artist is defined as the country where he or she was born, or the band was founded.
What makes this task a challenge is foremost that the origin
is neither always unambiguous, nor well-known. Consider,
for example, Farrokh Bulsara, later known as Freddie Mercury. He was born in Zanzibar, Tanzania. However, he
relocated to the UK at the age of 17, where he later became
world famous as co-founder of the band Queen. Mercury’s
country of origin is nevertheless Tanzania, whereas Queen’s
is the UK. This example highlights the problem of determining the origin in cases where the main country of musical
activity differs from the place of birth.
Earlier work on predicting the origin of a music artist
mainly consists of [3, 4]. In contrast to our approaches that
may – at least in theory – use the whole Web as data source,
Govaerts and Duval focus on specific Web sites, such as
last.fm, Wikipedia, and Freebase, and apply heuristic func-

In this formulation tft,a denotes the number of occurrences
of term t in the 100-page-set retrieved for artist a, dft represents the number of pages where t occurs among the complete set of all Web pages retrieved, and n is the total number of pages retrieved. The origin of an artist a is then determined by predicting the country whose name ranks highest
with respect to the employed term weighting function.
The third approach uses text distance measures between
country names and origin-related key terms, such as “born”,
“founded”, “origin”, or “country”, on the set of top-ranked
Web pages. Based on the offset at character-level between
the country terms and the origin-related key terms in a’s
pages, we build a model of a’s most likely country of origin. The core part of this model integrates two different
functions: a distance measure on the intra-page-level (ipl)
to determine the distances within a Web page of a, and an
aggregation function (af) to combine the ipl-distances for all
pages retrieved for a. The choice of these two functions is

vital to the quality of the prediction. For the evaluation
experiments described next, we use the following scheme to
describe a setting: {key1 , · · · , keyn }, ipl, af .

Using Country Synonyms.
We further looked into using synonyms for countries and
nationalities, extracted from Thesaurus.com. A complete
list of the used mappings country 7→ hsyn1 , · · · , synn i is
available.2 This step is motivated by the fact that certain
countries, such as the “United States” (of America), are often wrongly predicted due to their ambiguity, and abundant
presence on the Web.

EVALUATION AND DISCUSSION

Since there exists no standardized data set for this kind of
task and we did not have access to the one used in [3], we
manually extracted 578 artists and their country of origin
from sources such as allmusic.com, last.fm, and Wikipedia.3
We included artists from 69 distinct countries of the world.
Table 1 shows the evaluation results in terms of coverage
(or recall ), precision, and F-measure [7]. Coverage denotes
the share of artists for which a country could be determined,
precision is the share of artists whose origin is correctly predicted among the number of artists for which a prediction
was made, and the F-measure aggregates precision and recall via the weighted harmonic mean. The best-performing
approaches within each category are printed in bold.
The page counts approach seems to be too simple to capture the country of origin correctly. The term weighting
approaches yield overall the best results. Interestingly, tf
and df measures outperform tf · idf . Even though tf · idf is
the standard approach in text-based IR, it underperforms
in this specific IE task. This is likely a result of tf · idf ’s
penalization of terms that occur in a large number of documents. Suppressing such terms does make sense in most IR
tasks. In our IE task, however, general and popular terms
should not be given less weight. The text distance approach
performs worse than expected. The reason for this bad performance may be an unfavorable set of key terms. We will
investigate this as part of future work.
Table 2 shows the best evaluation results from Govaerts
and Duval [3]. Comparing Tables 1 and 2, our approaches
perform, in general, better with respect to coverage and Fmeasure. In terms of precision, the picture is more diversified. While Govaerts and Duval’s combined method reaches
about 77% precision (at a 59%-recall-level), our best method
in terms of precision achieves about 71% (but at a 100%recall-level).

CONCLUSIONS

We presented three parameterizable heuristics to determine
the origin of a person or institution and applied these heuristics with different settings to a set of music artists and bands.
We were able to outperform earlier work in terms of coverage and F-measure, while retaining precision levels. Future
work will include refining our methods by combining them
with NLP techniques or estimates of Web page reputation.

Employing the Wilcoxon signed-rank test on each pair of approaches (with and without synonyms) revealed significant
difference for tf · idf -based approaches. Furthermore, three
of the approaches based on text distances perform significantly worse if synonyms are used. This may be explained
by ambiguous synonyms, such as “US” or “Sam”.
