ABSTRACT

Link activity

Freshness has been increasingly realized by commercial search engines as an important criteria for measuring the quality of search
results. However, most information retrieval methods focus on the
relevance of page content to given queries without considering the
recency issue. In this work, we mine page freshness from web
user maintenance activities and incorporate this feature into web
search. We first quantify how fresh the web is over time from two
distinct perspectives—the page itself and its in-linked pages—and
then exploit a temporal correlation between two types of freshness
measures to quantify the confidence of page freshness. Results
demonstrate page freshness can be better quantified when combining with temporal freshness correlation. Experiments on a realworld archival web corpus show that incorporating the combined
page freshness into the searching process can improve ranking performance significantly on both relevance and freshness.

Page Freshness Estimation

We start by quantifying web freshness over time. We assign every
page two types of freshness: (1) page freshness (PF) inferred from
the activities on the page itself; and (2) in-link freshness (InF) inferred from the activities of in-links. Table 1 lists the detailed web
activities and their contributions1 to page and in-link freshness. To
simplify analysis, we break the time axis into discrete time points
(t0 , t1 , . . . , ti , . . .) with a unit time interval Δt = ti − ti−1 , where
i > 0. It is reasonable to assume that any activities that occur
in [ti−1 , ti ] can be considered as occurring at ti , especially when
Δt is small. We assume that the influence of activity decays exponentially over time. Therefore, we estimate PF and InF at ti by
aggregating the web activities with such a decay, written as:

Introduction

Web search engines exploit a variety of evidence in ranking web
pages to satisfy users’ information needs as expressed by the submitted queries. These information needs may contain distinct implicit demands, such as relevance and diversity. Recency is another
such need, and so is utilized as an important criteria in the measurement of search quality. However, most information retrieval
methods only match queries based on lexical similarity. Link-based
ranking algorithms such as PageRank [1] typically favor old pages
since the authority scores are estimated based on a static web structure and old pages have more time to attract in-links.
To overcome this problem, we quantify page freshness from web
activities over time. We observe that pages and links may have
diverse update activity distributions from inception to deletion time
points. We infer that pages having similar activity distributions
with their in-links suggest that such page activities have stronger
influence on their parents’ activities.
Motivated by the above analysis, in this work we incorporate
a temporal freshness correlation (TFC) component in quantifying
page freshness, and show that by using TFC, we can achieve a good
estimate of how up-to-date the page tends to be, which is helpful
to improve search quality in terms of both result freshness and rel-

the kth type of page activity on link l at tj , and P A and LA are
the page and link activity sets. In this way, we estimate web page
freshness at multiple predefined time points from web activities.

We next quantify the temporal freshness correlation between
pages and their in-links. We exploit the method by Chien and Immorlica [3], in which the authors measure query semantic similarity
by using temporal correlation. Given a page p, its page and in-link
freshness are denoted as (P Ftc (p), P Ftc+1 (p), . . . , P Ftr (p)) and
(InFtc (p), InFtc+1 (p), . . . , InFtr (p)) covering p’s life span.
The temporal freshness correlation (TFC) between page p and its
in-links is given by:
tr
1 X “ P Ft (p) − P F (p) ”“ InFt (p) − InF (p) ”
n t=t
σP F (p)
σInF (p)
c

where σP F (p) and σInF (p) are the standard deviations of P F (p)
and InF (p), respectively.
Once we calculate the temporal freshness correlation for every
page (tr − tc ≥ 2Δt), we next combine it with page freshness
score by ranks. Given a time point of interest ti , the combined
page freshness rank of document d is written as:

Our goal is to improve web search quality on both relevance and
freshness. To test the effect of combined page freshness on web
search, we use an archival corpus of the .ie domain provided by
the Internet Archive [5], covering from Jan. 2000 to Dec. 2007, and
extract page and link activities. To minimize the influence of transient pages, we remove pages with fewer than 5 archival snapshots.
The remaining sub-collection (with 3.8M unique URLs and 908M
temporal links) is used for ranking evaluation.
We choose April 2007 as our time point of interest. 90 queries
are selected from popular queries in Google Trends2 for evaluation.
For each query, we have an average of 84.6 URLs labeled by at least
one worker of Amazon Mechanical Turk3 . Editors give judgments
on each document with respect to a given query for both relevance
and freshness. Relevance is judged from “highly relevant” (4) to
“not related” (0). Freshness is judged from “very fresh” (4) to “very
stale” (0). The document with an average score above 2.5 is marked
as relevant/fresh.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the combined page freshness, we
compare with PageRank, running on a single web snapshot of April
2007. The global ranking lists generated by the combined page
freshness and PageRank scores are linearly combined with Okapi
BM2500 [6] (baseline) by ranks individually. The parameters are
the same as Cai et al. [2]. Precision@k and NDCG@k are used
as metrics for ranking evaluation on both relevance and freshness.
All methods are compared based on their best rank combination of
query-specific scores and global scores on metric Precision@10 of
relevance. The decay parameter α is set to 1 in this work.
Table 2 lists the ranking performance comparison varying the
time span involved in the combined page freshness computation.
For relevance, except for NDCG@3, the correlation between ranking performance and the time span is not consistent. Unlike relevance, freshness performance consistently improves with the increase of time span used in the combined page freshness computation. This suggests temporal freshness correlation calculated from

long-term web freshness measures can benefit more on accurate
page freshness estimation. Figure 1 shows the performance on
NDCG@3 with the variance of the time span for both relevance
and freshness. We observe that (1) the ranking performance of
page freshness first decreases, and then keeps nearly constant with
the increase of time span, indicating the page activities within the
past 1-2 years influence page freshness estimation the most; (2)
the ranking performance of temporal freshness correlation shows
unstable trends with variance of time span; and (3) the combined
page freshness shows promising performance, and demonstrates its
superiority over either page freshness or TFC.
