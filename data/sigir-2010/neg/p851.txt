ABSTRACT

Optimal sigma for baseline prediction
0.5

We propose a method to predict a user’s favourite locations
in a city, based on his Flickr geotags in other cities. We
deﬁne a similarity between the geotag distributions of two
users based on a Gaussian kernel convolution. The geotags
of the most similar users are then combined to rerank the
popular locations in the target city personalised for this user.
We show that this method can give personalised travel recommendations for users with a clear preference for a speciﬁc
type of landmark.

PERSONALISED TRAVEL GUIDES
2.

Before visiting a city, many people consult a travel guide
or website that lists the most interesting locations. These
travel guides are commonly based on the opinions of all other
users. However, people have diﬀerent preferences and therefore are not equally satisﬁed by these popularity rankings.
We propose to predict a user’s favourite locations in a city
based on his travel behaviour in previously visited cities. On
social photo sharing websites like www.flickr.com people
can annotate their photos, including the geographical location where the photo was made. Also, increasingly more
cameras and smartphones are automatically storing the GPS
coordinates when a photo is made. These geotags give an
accurate indication of the user’s preferred landmarks. Based
on a set of collected geotags, we deﬁne a measure to identify
similar users in previously visited cities. Then we aggregate
these users’ opinions in a diﬀerent city to obtain a personalized travel recommendation for the target user.
The exploitation of geotags has shown to be eﬀective for
various tasks, like global event detection [3] and mapping
textual tags to geographical locations [1]. Based on users’
GPS tracks, location recommenders have been proposed that
attempt to predict popular places and activities near the
current location of the user [5, 4].
In this work we predict relevant locations based on users’
geotags in a geographically remote location. We show statistical improvements over all users that visited the 10 largest
cities and give an eﬀective recommendation example based
on an artiﬁcial user proﬁle.

FLICKR GEOTAGS

Using the public Flickr API we have collected the geotags of 36,264 users, who actively use the geotag functionality. Together these users have uploaded 52,425,279 photos
of which 22,710,496 have been geotagged.
We keep the data points that lie within the bounding
boxes of the ten most visited cities. Based on our data, these
cities in order of visitors are: London, New York, Paris,
San Fransisco, Los Angeles, Rome, Chicago, Washington,
Barcelona, Berlin. We only keep users who have made at
least 5 photos in at least two cities. After this constraint the
number of geotags of a single user in a city ranges from 5
to 5073 photos, and in total the 4750 remaining users have
made 12,669 city visits. Together the users made 526,827
photos on the qualifying trips.

METHODOLOGY & RESULTS

Baseline ranking As a baseline prediction we create a
scale space representation of all the geotags in each city using a mean shift algorithm, similar to Crandall et al. [1], but
using a Gaussian kernel instead of a uniform disc: K(z) =
2
2
e−z /2σ , where the standard deviation σ is used as a scaling parameter. This method ﬁnds the maximum values of
a kernel convolution of the distribution of all users’ geotags
with a Gaussian kernel (ΦAll ). To ensure we reach all local maxima, we initiate the mean shift algorithm with all
individual geotags. For each subsequent scale we use the
peaks found in the previous scale to initiate the optimalisation procedure. The ranking based on the resulting peak

p < 0.05). For most users the improvement will however not
make a big practical diﬀerence in the recommended locations. Compared to traditional collaborative ﬁltering data
sets, we ﬁnd that many more people conform to the global
popularity ranking if landmarks are concerned. For example, almost all people who visit Paris will make a photo of
the Eiﬀel tower, while people who do not like Sci-Fi movies
will never watch Star Wars even though it is one of the
most highly ranked movies all times. This makes improving over the baseline a challenging task. Also, we observe
many mixed preferences in user proﬁles (e.g. there are no
users who only make photos at zoos), this makes it hard to
match similar users.
As an example of the potential beneﬁt of personalized
travel recommendations, we created an artiﬁcial user proﬁle
with 10 geotags scattered around two modern/contemporary
art landmarks in Barcelona (MACBA and Miro foundation). Table 1 shows a completely personalised ranking (with
θ = 1) and the rank diﬀerence between the baseline and the
personalised ranking for modern art museums in other cities.
It is clear that in all other cities where a modern art museum was in the top-50 we obtain a big rank improvement
between the baseline and the predicted ranking.
Conclusions A user’s favourite landmarks in a previously
unvisited city can be predicted by reranking the most popular locations based on users with similar travel preference.
Our results indicate that statistical improvement over all
users is hard to achieve, but for users with a clear travel
preference very accurate predictions can be made.

weights gives us the top landmarks for each city, based on
the general popularity.
To evaluate the ranking we judge a recommended location
lj as correct if the target user ut has a geotag i within the
positive cutoﬀ value (P C) of that location, ∃i : |lj − ut (i)| <
P C. Figure 1 gives the mean MAP@50 over the 10 cities,
which computes the mean over the precision after each correct prediction in the top-50.
Figure 1 shows that the optimal σ is strongly dependent
on the choice of P C. The predictions in this paper will be
evaluated at P C = 100 meter, which is roughly the radius
of a landmark (e.g. the Colosseum is 189m. long). Based on
the baseline results at P C = 100 we select σ = 68m. for all
further experiments.
Personalised reranking To personalise the landmark
ranking for ut in the target city (Ct ), we compute the similarity between ut and all other users uc in the similarity
city (Cs ), where Ct and Cs are any two cities from the top10, both visited by ut . Using the mean shift algorithm we
compute the peaks of ut at σ = 68m in Cs . For each peak
k of ut we now compute the value of the kernel convolution (Φuc (k)) on the geotags of uc in Cs . The similarity
between the two users is now derived by computing the
sum over thePminimum value in the two resulting proﬁles
S(ut , uc ) =
k min(Φut (k), Φuc (k)). As both proﬁles are
normalised, this will give a similarity score in the range 0-1.
Based on all similar users we now rerank the top-50 popular locations lj , predicted by the baseline method in Ct .
This is done by recomputing the kernel convolution at these
locations while weighing each user’s geotags
with his simiP
larity to the target user: ΦSim (lj ) = uc S(ut , uc )Φuc (lj ).
The top-50 locations are now reranked by a linear combination of the baseline and the personalised score: R(lj ) =
(1 − θ)ΦAll (lj ) + θΦSim (lj ).
Figure 2 gives the mean results over all users in the 90 possible combinations of two cities. The baseline is represented
by the score at θ = 0, where all user similarities are set to
1. Compared to the baseline, the optimal result on MAP
improves 0.3%. At θ = 0.2 there are 10,081 trips where we
present an improved ranking to the user, against 8,440 trips
where the baseline ranking would have been better. We also
show the NDCG (refer to [2] for details) where the gain of
each correct prediction is assigned as the inverse popularity
of that location (1/ΦAll (lj )). The increase in NDCG shows
that our recommender suggests less popular and therefore
more serendipitous locations.
The improvement on MAP@50 is statistically signiﬁcant
in 22 out of 90 city pairs (based on a paired t-test with
