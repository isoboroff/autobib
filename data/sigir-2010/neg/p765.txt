algorithms [2] and the algorithms particularly designed for query
[3] may fail when the queries are short with limited context.

ABSTRACT
Recently, the problem of Named Entity Recognition in Query
(NERQ) is attracting increasingly attention in the field of
information retrieval. However, the lack of context information in
short queries makes some classical named entity recognition
(NER) algorithms fail. In this paper, we propose to utilize the
search session information before a query as its context to address
this limitation. We propose to improve two classical NER
solutions by utilizing the search session context, which are known
as Conditional Random Field (CRF) based solution and Topic
Model based solution respectively. In both approaches, the
relationship between current focused query and previous queries
in the same session are used to extract novel context aware
features. Experimental results on real user search session data
show that the NERQ algorithms using search session context
performs significantly better than the algorithms using only
information of the short queries.

In this paper we propose to address the NERQ problem by
utilizing the context information in search sessions, once used to
perform QC [1]. We extract two new types of features from the
search sessions, namely class feature and overlap feature to help
performing NERQ.

1. INTRODUCTION
Nowadays, the Named Entity Recognition problem in Query
(NERQ) has attracted increasingly attention from information
retrieval community since it can be used to fix a number of failure
cases in the relevance based search engines. Figure 1 gives an
example of failure case in a commonly used commercial search
engine. If we can identify “Eagle Vision” as a named entity in
query, this irrelevant result will not be returned to end users with
high rank. To our best knowledge, there are only a few previous
studies that have tried to recognize named entities in queries. As
one of the earliest related works, Guo et al [3] has tried to use a
topic model to identify named entities in queries and they showed
that around 70% of the real search queries contain named entities.
However, since the queries are always very short (i.e., 2-3 words
on average) and many of them do not satisfy the natural language
grammar [3], both the classical Named Entity Recognition (NER)

session context is used as baseline, which is represented by CRF.
On the other hand, our approach is the CRF algorithm that uses
our proposed session level context features. We name it as the
Context aware CRF (CCRF). The evaluation metrics used for the
two classifiers are precision, recall and F-measure. Results of
evaluation comparison of the two classifiers are shown in Table 1.

2.2 Applications of New Features
In the CRF [4] based method, two new types of search session
features are used by the classifier. Following are the details of the
new features:


Class feature: using every element of
in Definition-1 as
a CRF feature.

Overlap feature: using every element of
in
Definition-2 as a CRF feature.
In the Topic Model based method, a single-named-entity
query is represented as triples , , , where denotes named
entity, denotes the context of in , and denotes the class of
[3]. In our experiment, for simplicity, only one query before the
current focused query is considered. In online prediction, we try to
segment both the current focused query and the previous query in
all possible ways together, and the triples with the
highest
value are output results for NERQ.

In the experiment by using topic model, 160 car names are
selected as seed named entities. We constructed the topic model in
the same way with the work [3] using the seeds and search engine
log. 1,000 query pairs in the same search session were randomly
selected from the dataset, generated in the experiment of using
CRF, as test set. In this experiment, the Topic Model without
considering search session context is used as baseline. In contrast,
our approach is the Topic Model algorithm that has used the
search session context features. We name it as the Context aware
Topic Model (Ca Topic Model). We use two word indexes of the
query to label the beginning and the ending of the named entity in
the query. The evaluation metrics used for the two topic models
are precision. The experiment results are shown in Table 2.

4. CONCLUSION

3. EXPERIMENTS

In this extended abstract, we proposed two context aware features
extracted from user search sessions to tackle the problem of
named entity recognition in query. We applied the two features to
improve two classical NER algorithms, which are known as
Conditional Random Field (CRF) and Topic Model. The
experimental results on real user search session data show that the
NERQ algorithms using search session context through our
proposed features can perform significantly better than the
classical NER algorithms using the short query information only.

In the experiments of this work, we only use the car model
domain queries for demonstration. We have two sets of
experiments by CRF and topic model respectively to compare the
NERQ results with and without context information in search
sessions.
In the experiment of using CRF model for NERQ, we start with a
small car name dictionary which contains 1,663 standard car
names to build a dataset for evaluation. Using the car name
dictionary, we firstly scan one month’s click-through log data of a
commercial web search engine. If a query which contains car
names in the car name dictionary is found by exact match, then all
the queries in the same search session are added to our dataset
with the query order in session unchanged. In this experiment, we
defined 5 named entity (NE) tags, namely 0 (Not entity), 1 (Single
word entity), 2 (Beginning of the entity), 3 (Middle of the entity),
4 (Ending of the entity). We have asked 10 human labelers to
manually label car domain named entities in queries of our
dataset. From the labeled data, 5000 queries and their
corresponding search sessions are used as training set and 1000
queries in remaining search sessions are used as testing set. In this
