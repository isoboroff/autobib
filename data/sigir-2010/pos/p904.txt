Abstract: This tutorial is concerned with a comprehensive
introduction to the research area of learning to rank for
information retrieval. In the first part of the tutorial, we will
introduce three major approaches to learning to rank, i.e., the
pointwise, pairwise, and listwise approaches, analyze the
relationship between the loss functions used in these approaches
and the widely-used IR evaluation measures, evaluate the
performance of these approaches on the LETOR benchmark
datasets, and demonstrate how to use these approaches to solve
real ranking applications. In the second part of the tutorial, we will
discuss some advanced topics regarding learning to rank, such as
relational ranking, diverse ranking, semi-supervised ranking,
transfer ranking, query-dependent ranking, and training data
preprocessing. In the third part, we will briefly mention the recent
advances in statistical learning theory for ranking, which explain
the generalization ability and statistical consistency of different
ranking methods. In the last part, we will conclude the tutorial and
show several future research directions.

General Terms: Algorithms, Experimentation, Theory.
Keywords: Learning to Rank, Information Retrieval, Learning
Theory, Ranking Models.

Communication and Image Representation (2004~2006). He is a
Program Committee Co-Chair of RIAO (2010), an Area Chair of
SIGIR (2008~2010) and AIRS (2009~2010), a Co-Chair of SIGIR
workshop on learning to rank for IR (2007~2009), a Co-Chair of
ICML workshop on learning to rank (2010), and a Program
Committee member of many other international conferences such
as WWW, ICML, KDD, WSDM, and ACL. He is on the Editorial
Board of the Information Retrieval Journal (IRJ), and is a guest
editor of the special issue on learning to rank of IRJ. He has given
tutorials on learning to rank at several conferences including
SIGIR 2008, WWW 2008, and WWW 2009.
