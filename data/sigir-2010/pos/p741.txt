ABSTRACT

of the probabilities associated to two events is the sum of
the probabilities of the events and their “interference” (i.e.
pAB = pA + pB + IAB )1 [4]. Under the QPRP, the documents in the ranking share relationships at relevance level,
i.e. they interfere with each other, and this interference has
to be taken into account when ranking documents.
An open problem in the development of the QPRP is:
how to eﬀectively estimate/approximate this interference
term? In other words: how can the interference between
documents be approximated, and does this translate into
eﬀective retrieval performance for tasks, such as subtopic
retrieval, where it is imperative that interdependent document relevance is considered? In this poster, we empirically
investigate several strategies to approximate the interference
term in the QPRP on two TREC collections for subtopic retrieval.

The Quantum Probability Ranking Principle (QPRP) has
been recently proposed, and accounts for interdependent
document relevance when ranking. However, to be instantiated, the QPRP requires a method to approximate the
“interference” between two documents. In this poster, we
empirically evaluate a number of diﬀerent methods of approximation on two TREC test collections for subtopic retrieval. It is shown that these approximations can lead to
signiﬁcantly better retrieval performance over the state of
the art.

2. APPROXIMATING INTERFERENCE

INTRODUCTION

In this section we propose a number of approaches to approximate the interference term of an instantiation of the
QPRP in the context of subtopic retrieval. We set cos θd,d =
−fsim (d, d ), where fsim (d, d ) is a similarity function between the (normalised) term vectors of documents d and
d .This results in demoting similar documents in the ranking while diverse and novel documents are promoted. With
this substitution, the interference term becomes:
p
p
Id,d = − P (d) P (d )fsim (d, d )
(2)
In the empirical investigation proposed in our study, the
components of the term vector of a document are the Okapi
BM25 weights corresponding to each term occurring in the
document. We test two diﬀerent working hypothesis when
computing fsim between the documents already present in
the ranking (e.g. d1 , . . . , di−1 ) and the current candidate
document d:
1. pairwise: the user judges the interest of the current document by comparing it to each of the previous
ranked documents: in this case, the current candidate
and the documents already ranked are compared using
fsim in a pairwise fashion;
2. surrogates: the user judges the interest of the current document by comparing it to the knowledge he acquired from documents d1 , . . . , di−1 : the current candidate is then compared against a surrogate of the documents already ranked, which is obtained interpolating2
d1 , . . . , di−1 .

The Probability Ranking Principle (PRP) provides a theoretically sound ranking strategy, that assumes the independence between document relevance [7]. To move beyond
independence, a number of ranking strategies have been proposed which account for interdependent document relevance
assessments [6, 8, 9]. A theoretically motivated development
that also accounts for this limitation is the recently proposed
Quantum Probability Ranking Principle (QPRP) [11]. However, to instantiate a retrieval model that upholds the QPRP
the “interference” between documents needs to be estimated
(see [10] for more details). This ranking principle prescribes
that documents should be ranked according to:
!
X
di = arg max P (d) +
(1)
Id,d
d ∈RA

= arg max P (d) +

X p

p
P (d) P (d ) cos θd,d

!

d ∈RA

where Id,d is the interference between documents d and
d , P (d) is the estimated probability of relevance of document d, and RA is the list of documents already ranked.
The angle θd,d is the diﬀerence between the phases of the
probability amplitudes associated to documents d and d .
The interference term arises because in quantum probability
theory, the total probability obtained from the composition

EMPIRICAL STUDY AND RESULTS

fact is signiﬁcantly better on several measures. It should also
be noted that since the QPRP based methods do not require
extensive parameter tuning like PT, the KL and Pearson instantiations of the QPRP are highly competitive, simple and
attractive alternatives.

To study the eﬀectiveness of the strategies proposed in the
previous section, we evaluate the QPRP in the context of
subtopic retrieval, employing the TREC 678 interactive collection with the subtopics judgements described in [9], and
the recent ClueWeb collection (part B only), along with the
topics deﬁned for the Web diversity track. Using the Lemur
Toolkit 4.10 we indexed these collections, where stemming
was applied and stop words removed. For the QPRP, we
test both pairwise and surrogate comparisons, and examine a number of similarity functions to act as fsim : L1 and
L2 norms, cosine similarity, Jaccard coeﬃcients, Pearson’s
correlation, Bayesian correlation score, KL, JSD, skew divergences [5]. The best performing approximations are reported
here. Each of the diﬀerent QPRP approximations were compared against the default PRP baseline, i.e. Okapi BM25
and against the state of the art Portfolio Theory (PT) [8]3 .
For PT, we tuned the parameters in each collection to maximise α-ndcg@10. All the models have been implemented
in C++/Lemur and code is available on request. We evaluated each model employing the diversity measures suggested
in [1, 2, 3, 9].
In Table 1 we report the results for the PRP (i.e. BM25),
PT and a subset of the approximations we tried for the
QPRP models. First of all we note that the KL based QPRP
model performs the best on each collection when surrogates
are used in the TREC 678 and pairwise comparisons are used
on ClueWeb. These diﬀerences might be due to the limited
number of topics available for the TREC 678 collection (20
in total), but also because of the diﬀerent kind of documents
in these collections (newswire articles vs. Web pages). Furthermore, while no signiﬁcance can be calculated for the
improvements on TREC 678 due to the number of topics,
improvements over PRP and PT obtained on ClueWeb are
statistically signiﬁcant. The Pearson based QPRP consistently provides excellent retrieval performance regardless of
the comparison method - and while this is not always better
than the optimised PT, it is not signiﬁcantly worse, and in

4. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS
In this poster we have investigated a number of strategies to approximate the interference term in the QPRP.
Our results show that excellent retrieval performances can
be consistently obtained when employing the Pearson based
QPRP, while, the KL based QPRP provides the best subtopic
retrieval performances overall. Future work will examine
what type of comparison (i.e. surrogate or pairwise) should
be employed given the data collection, along with incorporating other types of approximations of interference within
the QPRP.

form the surrogate. Alternative approaches might perform weighted
interpolations of these vectors, in order to simulate user’s memory effects (e.g. documents retrieved at early ranks are weighted less than
documents at ranks close to i) or estimated importance of documents
(e.g. documents ranked at early positions contribute more in generating the surrogate than lower ranked ones).

Note, we have treated the variance of a document, σ2 , as a parameter
of the PT model and conducted a grid search of the parameter space
b (the user propensity to risk) by σ2 to select the optimal run of PT
on each employed collection.
