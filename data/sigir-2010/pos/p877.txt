ABSTRACT

mine the likelihood of the topic being a central theme of the blog,
using a blog-based approach.
We hypothesize that by pruning the list of posts taken into account in stage 1, and thus focusing on the most interesting utterances, we can achieve improvements over a blog-based model
baseline on effectiveness and, as a result of blog selection, also on
efficiency. Furthermore, we expect to see a considerable improvement on precision when applying pruning, and more so, when using
a lean, title-only document representation in stage 1.

We consider blog feed search: identifying relevant blogs for a given
topic. An individual’s search behavior often involves a combination
of exploratory behavior triggered by salient features of the information objects being examined plus goal-directed in-depth information seeking behavior. We present a two-stage blog feed search
model that directly builds on this insight. We first rank blog posts
for a given topic, and use their parent blogs as selection of blogs
that we rank using a blog-based model.

General Terms:

Previous work in blog feed search centered around two families
of approaches: blog-based models and post-based models. Blogbased models use posts to construct a model for each blog. Ranking is done by matching the query against these blog models. Examples of blog-based models include the Blogger model [1] and
the Long Document model [2]. The other type of approaches,
post-based models, start from a ranking of blog posts and scores
of individual posts are aggregated in order to infer a ranking of
blogs [1, 2, 4]; these models boil down to estimating the relevance
of blog posts and associating these posts to their parent blogs, using some weighted association value. Various ways of aggregating
scores [4] and association values [2, 9] have previously been discussed. Both families of approaches have problems: post-based
models ignore the recurring interest requirement; just a few relevant posts in a blog can be enough for it to be ranked high, even
though other posts are non-relevant. On the other hand, blog-based
models can become quite inefficient when applied to large numbers
of frequently updated blogs, where each consists of several posts.

INTRODUCTION

We focus on blogs: the unedited, unregulated voice of an individual [5], as published on a web page containing time-stamped
entries. The blogosphere has shown a huge increase in volume in
recent years, and is now a major source of information online. To
allow for end users to follow a blog that regularly covers a given
topic, we can provide them with a ranking of blogs that are likely to
show a recurring interest in the topic. This task of identifying topically relevant blogs is referred to as blog feed search. Even though
the unit of retrieval is blogs, the indexing unit should be blog posts,
as this allows for easy incremental indexing, and the use of a single
index for both blog feed search and blog post retrieval. Indeed, all
current approaches to this task use a post index [1, 2, 4, 6].
We propose a two-stage model to blog feed search. The model
exploits the following observation about human strategies for identifying complex information objects such as blogs (or people, for
that matter). Prior to in-depth examination of complex information objects, humans display exploratory search behavior triggered
by salient features of such objects [3]. This insight gives rise to the
following two-stage model for blog feed search. In stage 1, we take
individual utterances (i.e., posts) to play the role of “attention triggers” and select an initial sample of blogs based on the most interesting posts given the query, using a post-based approach. Here, we
define “interesting” as topically relevant, but more elaborate techniques can also be applied (e.g., credibility, novelty, etc. [8]). Then,
in stage 2, we only consider these most interesting blogs, which we
then examine more in-depth by considering all their posts to deter-

3. A TWO-STAGE MODEL
We are working in a language modeling setting and rank documents (blogs, posts) based on their likelihood of being generated
from the query. We use Bayes’ Theorem to rewrite this probability:
P (D|Q) = P (D)P (Q|D)/P (Q). As P (Q) does not influence
the ranking, we drop this term; we assume P (D), i.e., the a priori
belief of a document D being relevant, to be uniform. This term
can therefore be ignored. We are left with P (D|Q) ∝ P (Q|D). In
our specific case we rank blogs, and try to estimate the probability
P (Q|blog).
In stage 1, we are looking for salient utterances on the topic in
blog posts. Therefore, we rank posts for a given query using:

P (Q|θpost ) =
P (t|θpost )n(t,Q) ,

where P (t|θpost ) = (1−λpost )P (t|post)+λP (t) (i.e., smoothing

term t is present in the query. We use the top N most relevant
utterances (posts) to identify the set of possibly interesting blogs:

P (Q|θpost )P (post|blog) > 0},
(2)
B = {blog|
where P (post|blog) denotes the importance of a post given a blog,
which is assumed to be uniform. Note that the summation part in
Eq. 2 corresponds to a post-based model for ranking blogs, however, in our approach it is only used for identifying blogs that deserve to be ranked for the topic.
Having identified the set of possibly interesting blogs, we now
estimate the probability of each blog ∈ B having generated the
query, i.e., displaying a recurring interest in the topic:

P (Q|blog) ∝
P (t|θblog )n(t,Q) .

We represent blogs as a multinomial probability distributions over
the vocabulary terms, and infer a blog model θblog , such that the
probability of a term given the blog model is P (t|θblog ). To construct such a representation, we first aggregate all terms from posts
of the blog to estimate an empirical model:

P (t|blog) =
P (t|post) · P (post|blog).

Then, this probability P (t|blog) is smoothed using the background
collection probability P (t), to arrive at P (t|θblog ) (smoothing blogs
is done analogously to smoothing applied to posts).

posts and then determines whether the topic is a central concern.
Experiments show that the two-stage model can improve over a
blog-based model. Topic dependent pruning of the post list in stage
1 helps, and we can combine this with a lean document representation to improve early precision even further. Future work is aimed
at learning the optimal pruning level per topic.

EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS

We test whether our two-stage model is capable of effective blog
feed search. We perform two series of experiments. First, we investigate the amount of pruning applied, i.e., the value of N in
Eq. 2. We consider three settings: no pruning, topic-independent
pruning (train on 2007 topics, test on 2008, and vice versa), and
topic-dependent pruning (best empirically found values per topic).
The “no pruning” condition corresponds to the blog-based model
(Blogger model in [1]). Our second set of experiments concerns
the representation of posts for stage 1 of our approach. We compare the results of the two-stage model to a blog-based model only,
since blog-based models usually outperform post-based models [1].
The blog feed search task ran at TREC 2007 and 2008 [7] and
uses the TRECBlog06 corpus. We use the English blog posts, and
ignore blogs that only have 1 post. We have a total of 95 topics and
relevance judgments, and we only use the title field of the topics.
In our experiments, we optimize for MAP. Testing for significance
is done using a two-tailed paired t-test; significant differences are
indicated using  and  (α = 0.01), and  and  (α = 0.05).
Table 1 lists the results on the 2007 and 2008 topics for the blogbased model, and the various settings for stage 1 in our two-stage
model. Results show that our model is at least as effective as the
blog-based model, while being considerably more efficient: The
blog-based model examines all 2.5M blog-post associations, while
our two-stage model considers just 1% (23,700) in stage 2. Topic
independent pruning results in a slight improvement in effectiveness over the blog-based model, while topic dependent pruning
results in significant improvements. The use of a lean document
representation, with an average document length of just 12 words,
results in very good overall precision scores.
