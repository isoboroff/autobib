ABSTRACT

document could be retrieved using a given IR system, while
findability measures provide an indication of how easily a
document can be found by a user with the IR system. Here
we consider the accessibility measures based on retrievability (see [2] for more details and [3, 4] for examples of its
usage in practice.)
Retrievability: The retrievability r(d) of a document d
with respect to an IR system, is the ease with which it can
be retrieved given all possible queries Q1 . Formally,
X
r(d) ∝
f (kdq , c)

Typically the evaluation of Information Retrieval (IR) systems is focused upon two main system attributes: efficiency
and effectiveness. However, it has been argued that it is
also important to consider accessibility, i.e. the extent to
which the IR system makes information easily accessible.
But, it is unclear how accessibility relates to typical IR evaluation, and specifically whether there is a trade-off between
accessibility and effectiveness. In this poster, we empirically
explore the relationship between effectiveness and accessibility to determine whether the two objectives i.e. maximizing
effectiveness and maximizing accessibility, are compatible,
or not. To this aim, we empirically examine this relationship using two popular IR models and explore the trade-off
between access and performance as these models are tuned.

q∈Q

where q is a query in Q, kdq is the rank at which d is retrieved given q, and f (kdq , c) is a function which denotes
how accessible the document d is for the query q given the
rank cutoff c. A simple measure of retrievability employs an
access function f (kdq , c), such that if d is retrieved in the top
c documents given q, then f (kdq , c) = 1 else f (kdq , c) = 0.
This is referred to as a cumulative-based retrievability measure [2]; and it provides an intuitive value for each document,
i.e. it is the number of times that the document is retrieved
in the top c documents. To provide a single measure of
access given the retrievability scores for all documents, the
Gini measure [5] was proposed in [2]. Intuitively, if all documents were equally accessible according to r(d), then the
Gini would be zero (equality), while if all but one document
had r(d) = 0 then the Gini would be one (total inequality).
Usually, most documents have some level of retrievability
and the Gini measures is somewhere between zero and one.
Essentially, the Gini coefficient provides an indication of the
level of inequality between documents given how easily they
can be retrieved with a particular retrieval system.
It is important to note that retrievability can be estimated
without recourse to relevance judgments, making it an attractive alternative for automatic evaluation. That is, if
there is a positive correlation between accessibility and effectiveness based measures.
Relating Retrievability and Effectiveness: Given the
definition of retrievability then a purely random IR system
would provide equal access to all documents (i.e. Gini=0);
however, this would also result in very poor effectiveness.
While, if a (hypothetical) IR system retrieved the set of
known relevant documents, and only these documents, regardless of the query, then there would be a very high inequality among documents and Gini would be close to one.

INTRODUCTION

Historically, there have been two main ways to evaluate
an Information Retrieval (IR) system: efficiency and effectiveness [7]. A complementary and so-called higher order
evaluation has been recently proposed based on accessibility [1]. Instead of assessing how well the system performs in
terms of speed or performance, access-based measures provide an indication of how easily documents within the collection can be retrieved using a particular retrieval system [1].
Evaluations based on accessibility have been performed in a
number of different contexts (see [2, 6, 3, 4]), but there has
been little work examining the relationship between accessbased measures and effectiveness measures.

MEASURING ACCESSIBILITY

The accessibility of information in a collection given a system has been considered from two points of view, the system
side i.e. retrievability [2] and the user side findability [6]. Retrievability measures provide an indication of how easily a

Since we cannot know the set of all the possible queries, it is usually approximated using a large (order of 105 ) set of automatically
generated queries[2, 3, 4].

access and performance.

Neither extreme is desirable, but to what extent do we need
to trade-off retrievability for effectiveness. In this poster, we
examine the relationship between the Gini measure (i.e. the
summarized retrievability measure) and precision, by examining the change in each measure as the parameter values of
different retrieval models are varied.
Experimental Setup Two TREC collections were used:
Associated Press (AP) 1988-1989 and Wall Street Journal
(WSJ) 1987-1992, both with TREC query sets 1, 2 and 3.
Two popular IR models were selected: Multinomial Language Modelling with Bayes Smoothing and Okapi BM25.
For Language modelling, the smoothing parameter β was
varied from 10−4 to 105 in multiplicative steps of 10. For
BM25, the b parameter, which adjusts length normalisation,
was varied from 0.1 to 1.0 in steps of 0.1. Effectiveness was
measured using both precision at 10 (P@10) and mean average precision (MAP). To estimate retrievability, the same
methodology employed in [2] was applied, where we used
100,000 two-word queries derived from the most frequent
collocations found in each corpus to estimate the retrievability values. Retrievability was measured using the cumulative
measure (described above) where c = 10 and c = 100. The
degree of equality was measured using the Gini coefficient
denoted as Gini@10 and Gini@100, respectively.
Results In Figure 1, plots of the different measures are
shown for each model (top: Language Model, bottom: BM25)
and each collection (left: AP, right: WSJ) across the parameter values. From these plots, the first point of interest is that Gini varies considerably across the parameter
ranges for both models, where minimizing the Gini coefficient translates into providing more access to documents in
the collection (this is around β = 10 − 100 for the Language
Model and b = 0.6 − 0.8 for BM25. Of note, is that the suggested/default value for b is usually 0.75, which is well within
this range.). While this does not directly correspond to when
performance is maximized, the difference in performance is
quite small; in the range of (0.01-0.03 for both P@10 and
MAP). While, these differences in performance were significantly difference (p < 0.05 using Student’s T-test) for all but
BM25 on WSJ, there does appear to be a positive correlation
between the two measures, and this opens up the possibility of using access based measures to tune retrieval systems.
These findings suggest that a systematic relationship appears to exist between the gini measurements (representing
Accessibility) and the precision measurements (representing
Effectiveness).

DISCUSSION AND FURTHER WORK

This preliminary analysis of the relationship between accessibility measures (specifically retrievability measures) and
effectiveness measures shows that the two goals of maximizing access and maximizing performance are quite compatible. In fact, reasonably good retrieval performance is still
obtained by selecting parameters that maximize access (i.e.
when there is the least inequality between documents according to Gini given the r(d) values). This motivates the
hypothesis that retrieval models/systems can be effectively
tuned using access based measures. If this holds, then it
suggests that when relevance information is not available a
sensible approach to configuring a system is to ensure that
users can access all documents as easily as possible. However, further research is needed to test this hypothesize more
